He peered Hermione though never seen student
properly However legend speak
sensational even ludicrous tale But whole class
hanging Professor Binnss every word He looked dimly
every face turned Harry 149 could tell
completely thrown unusual show interest
Oh well said slowly Let see Chamber
Secrets You know course Hogwarts
founded thousand years ago precise date uncertain
four greatest witches wizards age The
four school Houses named Godric Gryffindor Helga Hufflepuff Rowena
Ravenclaw Salazar Slytherin They built castle together far prying
Muggle eyes age magic feared
common people witches wizards suffered much persecution He paused
gazed blearily around room continued For years
founders worked harmony together seeking youngsters showed signs
magic bringing castle educated But
disagreements sprang A rift began grow Slytherin
others Slytherin wished selective students
admitted Hogwarts He believed magical learning kept within
allmagic families He disliked taking students Muggle parentage believing
untrustworthy After serious argument
subject Slytherin Gryffindor Slytherin left school Professor
Binns paused pursing lips looking like wrinkled old tortoise
Reliable historical sources tell us much said But
honest facts obscured fanciful legend Chamber
Secrets The story goes Slytherin built 150
hidden chamber castle founders knew
nothing Slytherin according legend sealed Chamber Secrets
none would able open
true heir arrived school The heir alone would able
unseal Chamber Secrets unleash horror within use
purge school unworthy study
magic There silence finished telling story
wasnt usual sleepy silence filled Professor Binnss classes There
unease air everyone continued watch hoping
Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed The whole thing
arrant nonsense course said Naturally school searched
evidence chamber many times learned
witches wizards It exist A tale told frighten
gullible Hermiones hand back air Sir
exactly mean horror within Chamber
That believed sort monster

Binns I repeat likes Dumbledore But maybe

The villagers Little Hangleron still called Riddle
House even though many years since Riddle family

windows boarded tiles missing roof ivy spreading
unchecked face Once finelooking manor easily largest
grandest building miles around Riddle House damp
derelict unoccupied The Little Hagletons agreed old
house creepy Half century ago something strange horrible
happened something older inhabitants village still liked
discuss topics gossip scarce The story

many places nobody quite sure truth anymore
Every version tale however started place Fifty
years daybreak fine summers morning Riddle
House still well kept impressive maid entered
drawing room find three Riddles dead The maid
run screaming hill village roused
many people could Lying eyes wide
open Cold ice Still dinner things The police
summoned whole Little Hangleton seethed shocked
curiosity illdisguised excitement Nobody wasted breath pretending feel
sad Riddles unpopular Elderly Mr
Mrs Riddle rich snobbish rude
grownup son Tom anything worse All villagers cared
identity murderer plainly three apparently
healthy people drop dead natural causes
night The Hanged Man village pub roaring
trade night whole village seemed turned
discuss murders They rewarded leaving firesides
Riddles cook arrived dramatically midst announced suddenly
silent pub man called Frank Bryce arrested
Frank cried several people Never Frank Bryce Riddles

Hangleton doubted Frank Bryce killed Riddles But
neighboring town Great Hangleton dark dingy
police station Frank stubbornly repeating
innocent person seen near house
day Riddles deaths teenage boy
stranger darkhaired pale Nobody else village seen
boy police quite sure Frank invented
Then things looking serious Frank
report Riddles bodies came back changed everything The
police never read odder report A team doctors
examined bodies concluded none Riddles
poisoned stabbed shot strangles suffocated far could
tell harmed In fact report continued tone
unmistakable bewilderment Riddles appeared perfet health

note though determined find something wrong bodies
Riddles look terror upon
face frustrated police said whoever heard

flickering quality light started fire
Frank telephone case deeply mistrusted
police ever since taken questioning

upstairs fast bad leg would allow soon
back kitchen fully dressed removing rusty old key
hook door He picked walking stick
propped wall set night
The front door Riddle House bore sign
forced windows Frank limped around
back house reached door almost completely hidden
ivy took old key put lock
opened door noiselessly He let cavernous
kitchen Frank entered many years nevertheless although
dark remembered door hall
groped way towards nostrils full
smell decay ears pricked sound footsteps voices
overhead He reached hall little lighter owing
large mullioned windows either side front door
started climb stairs blessing dust lay thick
upon stone muffled sound feet

intruders At every end passage

think two sorts people would speak code

year old night Voldemort powerful Dark
wizard century wizard gaining power steadily
eleven years arrived house killed father

told scar hurting At
Hermione Grangers voice seemed fill head shrill panicky
Your scar hurt Harry thats really serious Write Professor Dumbledore
And Ill go check Common Magical Ailments Afflictions Maybe theres
something curse scars Yes
would Hermiones advice Go straight headmaster Hogwarts
meantime consult book Harry stared window
inky blueblack sky He doubted much whether book
could help As far knew
living person survived curse like Voldemorts
highly unlikely therefore would find symptoms listed Common
Magical Ailments Afflictions As informing headmaster Harry
idea Dumbledore went summer holidays He amused
moment picturing Dumbledore long silver beard full length wizards
robes pointed hat stretched beach somewhere rubbing suntan
lotion onto long crooked nose Wherever Dumbledore though Harry
sure Hedwig would able find Harrys owl
never yet failed deliver letter anyone even without
address But would write Dear Professor Dumbledore
Sorry bother scar hurt morning Yours

wouldnt I dunno Harry maybe curse scars
always twinge bit Ill ask Dad Mr

George Rons sixteenyear old twin brothers might think Harry losing
nerve The Weasleys Harrys favorite family world
hoping might invite stay time Ron
mentioned something Quidditch World Cup somehow didnt
want visit punctuated anxious inquiries scar Harry
kneaded forehead knuckles What really wanted felt
almost shameful admit someone like someone
like parent adult wizard whose advice could ask without
feeling stupid someone cared experience
Dark Magic And solution came It
simple obvious couldnt believe taken
long Sirius Harry leapt bed hurried
across room sat desk pulled
piece parchment toward loaded eaglefeather quill ink wrote
Dear Sirius paused wondering best phrase problem still
marveling fact hadnt thought Sirius straight away
But perhaps wasnt surprising
found Sirius godfather two months ago

Cest impossible said Madame Maxime whose enormous hand many
superb opals resting upon Fleurs shoulder Ogwarts cannot ave two champions
It injust We impression
Age Line would keep younger contestants Dumbledore said Karkaroff steely
smile still place though eyes colder ever Otherwise
would course brought along wider selection candidates
schools Its ones fault Potters Karkaroff
said Snape softly His black eyes alight malice Dont go
blaming Dumbledore Potters determination break rules He crossing
lines ever since arrived Thank Severus said
Dumbledore firmly Snape went quiet though eyes still glinted malevolently
curtain greasy black hair Professor Dumbledore

McGonagall angrily Really nonsense Harry could crossed line
Professor Dumbledore believes persuade
older student Im sure

Professor Snape Mr Crouch Mr Bagman said Karkaroff
voice unctuous er objective judges Surely
agree irregular Bagman wiped
round boyish face handkerchief looked Mr Crouch
standing outside circle firelight face half hidden
shadow He looked slightly eerie half darkness making look
much older giving almost skulllike appearance When spoke however
usual curt voice We must follow
rules rules state clearly people whose names come
Goblet Fire bound compete

Bagman beaming turning back Karkaroff Madame Maxime though
matter closed I insist upon resubmitting names

nature occur I half mind leave
Empty threat Karkaroff growled voice near door You
cant leave champion Hes got compete Theyve got
compete Binding magical contract like Dumbledore said Convenient eh Moody
entered room He limped toward fire
every right step took loud clunk Convenient
said Karkaroff Im afraid I dont understand Moody Harry could
tell trying sound disdainful though Moody
saying barely worth notice hands gave away
balled fists Dont said Moody quietly
Its simple Karkaroff Someone put Potters name goblet knowing

wished give Ogwarts two bites ze apple said Madame Maxime
I quite agree Madame Maxime said Karkaroff bowing I

teaching students fear assassination An odd quality
Defense Against Dark Arts teacher Dumbledore doubt
reasons Imagining things I growled Moody Seeing

There wholl turn innocent occasions advantage Moody
retorted menacing voice Its job think way
Dark wizards Karkaroff ought remember Alastor

Gryffindors turned remarkably cold toward whole lot One
Herbology lesson enough demonstrate It plain
Hufflepuffs felt Harry stolen champions glory feeling exacerbated
perhaps fact Hufflepuff House rarely got glory
Cedric one ever given
beaten Gryffindor Quidditch Ernie Macmillan Justin
FinchFletchley Harry normally got well talk
even though repotting Bouncing Bulbs
tray though laugh rather unpleasantly one
Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free Harrys grip smacked hard

making forced conversation though answered normally avoided
making eye contact Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed
distant Head Hufflepuff House
He would looking forward seeing Hagrid normal circumstances

vicious insults Slytherins highly unpopular
always helped Gryffindor beat often
Quidditch InterHouse Championship But
hoped Ravenclaws might found hearts support
much Cedric He wrong however Most Ravenclaws seemed
think desperate earn bit
fame tricking goblet accepting name Then
fact Cedric looked part champion

receiving admiration days Cedric Viktor Krum Harry actually saw
sixthyear girls keen get Krums

made head spin lungs empty
suddenly felt piercing pain either side neck Harry
clapped hands around throat felt two large slits
ears flapping cold air He
gills Without pausing think thing
made sense flung forward water The
first gulp icy lake water felt like breath life
His head stopped spinning took another great gulp water
felt pass smoothly gills sending oxygen back
brain He stretched hands front

feet become elongated toes webbed
It looked though sprouted flippers The water
didnt feel icy anymore either contrary felt pleasantly
cool light Harry struck
marveling far fast flipperlike feet propelled

incoming darkness forests rippling tangled black weed wide plains mud
littered dull glimmering stones He swam deeper deeper toward
middle lake eyes wide staring eerily
graylit water around shadow beyond water became
opaque Small fish flickered past like silver darts Once
twice thought saw something larger moving ahead
got nearer discovered nothing
large blackened log dense clump weed There
sign champions merpeople Ron thankfully
giant squid Light green weed stretched ahead
far could see two feet deep like meadow
overgrown grass Harry staring unblinkingly ahead trying

He ran hand unshaven face evidently thinking hard
All absences Barty Crouchs goes
trouble making sure houseelf saves seat
Quidditch World Cup doesnt bother turn watch He
works hard reinstate Triwizard Tournament stops coming
Its like Crouch If hes
ever taken day work illness Ill

darkened He suddenly looked menacing night
Harry first met night Harry still believed Sirius
murderer Oh I know Crouch right said
quietly He one gave order
sent Azkaban without trial What said Ron
Hermione together Youre kidding said Harry No Im
said Sirius taking another great bite chicken Crouch used
Head Department Magical Law Enforcement didnt know
Harry Ron Hermione shook heads He tipped
next Minister Magic said Sirius Hes great wizard Barty
Crouch powerfully magical powerhungry Oh never Voldemort supporter
said reading look Harrys face No Barty Crouch always
outspoken Dark Side But lot people
Dark Side well wouldnt
understand youre young Thats
dad said World Cup said Ron trace

flashed across Siriuss thin face All right Ill try
He walked cave back
said Imagine Voldemorts powerful You dont know supporters
dont know whos working isnt
know control people terrible things without
able stop Youre scared family
friends Every week news comes deaths disappearances
torturing Ministry Magics disarray
dont know theyre trying keep everything hidden
Muggles meanwhile Muggles dying Terror everywhere
panic confusion thats
used Well times like bring best
people worst others Crouchs principles mightve
good beginning I wouldnt know He rose quickly
Ministry started ordering harsh measures Voldemorts
supporters The Aurors given new powers powers kill rather
capture instance And I wasnt one
handed straight dementors without trial Crouch fought violence violence
authorized use Unforgivable Curses suspects I
would say became ruthless cruel many
Dark Side He supporters mind plenty people
thought going things right way
lot witches wizards clamoring take
Minister Magic When Voldemort disappeared looked like
matter time Crouch got top job But something
rather unfortunate happened Sirius smiled grimly Crouchs son caught
group Death Eaters whod managed talk way
Azkaban Apparently trying find Voldemort return
power Crouchs son caught gasped Hermione Yep
said Sirius throwing chicken bone Buckbeak flinging back
ground beside loaf bread tearing
half Nasty little shock old Barty Id imagine Should spent
bit time home family shouldnt Ought
left office early
gotten know son He began wolf
large pieces bread Was son Death Eater
said Harry No idea said Sirius still stuffing bread I
Azkaban brought This mostly
stuff Ive found since I got The boy definitely
caught company people Id bet life Death
Eaters might wrong place
wrong time like houseelf Did Crouch try
get son Hermione whispered Sirius let laugh
much like bark Crouch let son
I thought measure Hermione Anything
threatened tarnish reputation go dedicated
whole life becoming Minister Magic You saw dismiss
devoted houseelf associated Dark Mark
doesnt tell hes like Crouchs fatherly affection stretched
far enough give son trial accounts
wasnt much excuse Crouch show
much hated boy sent
straight Azkaban He gave son dementors
asked Harry quietly Thats right said Sirius didnt look
remotely amused I saw dementors bringing watched
bars cell door He cant
nineteen They took cell near mine He screaming
mother nightfall He went quiet days
though went quiet end
except shrieked sleep For moment
deadened look Siriuss eyes became pronounced ever
though shutters closed behind So hes still Azkaban
Harry said No said Sirius dully No hes
anymore He died year brought
He died He wasnt one said Sirius bitterly Most
go mad plenty stop eating end They
lose live You could always tell death
coming dementors could sense got excited That
boy looked pretty sickly arrived Crouch important Ministry
member wife allowed deathbed visit That
last time I saw Barty Crouch half carrying wife past
cell She died apparently shortly afterward Grief Wasted away
like boy Crouch never came sons body The dementors
buried outside fortress I watched Sirius
threw aside bread lifted mouth
instead picked flask pumpkin juice drained
So old Crouch lost thought
made continued wiping mouth back
hand One moment hero poised become Minister Magicnext
son dead wife dead family name dishonored Ive
heard since I escaped big drop popularity Once boy
died people started feeling bit sympathetic toward son
started asking nice young lad good family
gone badly astray The conclusion father never
cared much So Cornelius Fudge got top job
Crouch shunted sideways Department International Magical Cooperation
There long silence Harry thinking way Crouchs
eyes bulged hed looked disobedient houseelf back
wood Quidditch World Cup This must
Crouch overreacted Winky found beneath
Dark Mark It brought back memories son
old scandal fall grace Ministry Moody

As disappearance linked Barty Crouchs
And thinks happened Barty Crouch Minister said Moodys
growling voice I see two possibilities Alastor said Fudge Either Crouch

He wandered extremely quickly case Cornelius said
Dumbledore calmly Or else well Fudge sounded embarrassed Well Ill

trooped silence past closed door After
minute Harry heard clunks Moodys wooden leg growing
fainter corridor He looked around Hello Fawkes
said Fawkes Professor Dumbledores phoenix standing golden perch
beside door The size swan magnificent scarletandgold
plumage swished long tail blinked benignly Harry
Harry sat chair front Dumbledores desk For
several minutes sat watched old headmasters headmistresses snoozing
frames thinking heard running
fingers scar It stopped hurting He
felt much calmer somehow Dumbledores office knowing
would shortly telling dream Harry looked
walls behind desk The patched ragged Sorting
Hat standing shelf A glass case next
held magnificent silver sword large rubies set hilt
Harry recognized one pulled
Sorting Hat second year The sword
belonged Godric Gryffindor founder Harrys House He gazing
remembering come aid
thought hope lost noticed patch silvery
light dancing shimmering glass case He looked around
source light saw sliver silverwhite shining
brightly within black cabinet behind whose door
closed properly Harry hesitated glanced Fawkes got walked
across office pulled open cabinet door A shallow
stone basin lay odd carvings around edge runes
symbols Harry recognize The silvery light coming
basins contents like nothing Harry ever seen
He could tell whether substance liquid gas It
bright whitish silver moving ceaselessly surface
became ruffled like water beneath wind like clouds
separated swirled smoothly It looked like light made liquid
like wind made solid Harry couldnt make mind
He wanted touch find felt like
nearly four years experience magical world told
sticking hand bowl full unknown substance
stupid thing He therefore pulled wand
inside robes cast nervous look around
office looked back contents basin prodded
The surface silvery stuff inside basin began
swirl fast Harry bent closer head right inside
cabinet The silvery substance become transparent looked like glass He
looked expecting see stone bottom basin
saw instead enormous room surface
mysterious substance room seemed looking
circular window ceiling The room dimly lit
thought might even underground windows
merely torches brackets ones illuminated walls
Hogwarts Lowering face nose mere
inch away glassy substance Harry saw rows rows
witches wizards seated around every wall seemed
benches rising levels An empty chair stood
center room There something chair
gave Harry ominous feeling Chains encircled arms
though occupants usually tied Where
place It surely wasnt Hogwarts never seen room like
castle Moreover crowd mysterious room
bottom basin comprised adults Harry
knew nearly many teachers Hogwarts They
seemed thought waiting something even though could
see tops hats faces seemed
pointing one direction none talking
one another The basin circular room
observing square Harry could make going
corners He leaned even closer tilting head
trying see The tip nose touched strange
substance staring Dumbledores office gave almighty
lurch Harry thrown forward pitched headfirst substance
inside basin But head hit stone bottom
He falling something icycold black like
sucked dark whirlpool And suddenly Harry found sitting
bench end room inside basin
bench raised high others He looked high
stone ceiling expecting see circular window
staring nothing dark solid stone
Breathing hard fast Harry looked around Not one
witches wizards room least
two hundred looking Not one
seemed noticed fourteenyearold boy dropped
ceiling midst Harry turned wizard next
bench uttered loud cry surprise
reverberated around silent room He sitting right next
Albus Dumbledore Professor Harry said kind strangled whisper
Im sorry I didnt mean I looking
basin cabinet I
But Dumbledore didnt move speak He ignored Harry completely Like every
wizard benches staring far
corner room door Harry gazed
nonplussed Dumbledore around silently watchful crowd back
Dumbledore And dawned
Once Harry found somewhere nobody could see
hear That time fallen page
enchanted diary right somebody elses memory unless
much mistaken something sort happened
Harry raised right hand hesitated waved energetically
Dumbledores face Dumbledore blink look around
Harry indeed move And Harrys opinion settled
matter Dumbledore wouldnt ignore like He inside
memory presentday Dumbledore Yet couldnt
long ago Dumbledore sitting next
silverhaired like presentday Dumbledore But
place What wizards waiting Harry looked around

conclusions place heard footsteps
The door corner dungeon opened three people
entered least one man flanked two dementors
Harrys insides went cold The dementors tall hooded creatures whose faces
concealed gliding slowly toward chair center

Harry could make outline fine old house
hillside Cedric looked Triwizard Cup
Harry Did anyone tell cup
Portkey asked Nope said Harry He looking around
graveyard It completely silent slightly eerie Is supposed
part task I dunno said Cedric He
sounded slightly nervous Wands dyou reckon Yeah said Harry glad
Cedric made suggestion rather They pulled
wands Harry kept looking around He yet
strange feeling watched Someones coming
said suddenly Squinting tensely darkness watched
figure drawing nearer walking steadily toward graves Harry couldnt
make face way walking
holding arms could tell carrying something
Whoever short wearing hooded cloak pulled
head obscure face And several paces
nearer gap closing time Harry saw
thing persons arms looked like baby
merely bundle robes Harry lowered
wand slightly glanced sideways Cedric Cedric shot quizzical look
They turned back watch approaching figure It stopped
beside towering marble headstone six feet For
second Harry Cedric short figure simply looked
one another And without warning Harrys scar exploded pain
It agony never felt
life wand slipped fingers put hands
face knees buckled ground
could see nothing head split
open From far away head heard high
cold voice say Kill spare A swishing noise
second voice screeched words night Avada Kedavra
A blast green light blazed Harrys eyelids heard
something heavy fall ground beside pain
scar reached pitch retched diminished
terrified see opened stinging
eyes Cedric lying spreadeagled ground beside He
dead For second contained eternity Harry stared
Cedrics face open gray eyes blank expressionless
windows deserted house halfopen mouth looked
slightly surprised And Harrys mind accepted
seeing could feel anything numb disbelief felt
pulled feet The short man cloak
put bundle lit wand dragging Harry
toward marble headstone Harry saw name upon flickering
wandlight forced around slammed
TOM RIDDLE The cloaked man conjuring tight cords around Harry
tying neck ankles headstone Harry could hear
shallow fast breathing depths hood struggled
man hit hit hand
finger missing And Harry realized hood It
Wormtail You gasped But Wormtail finished conjuring
ropes reply busy checking tightness
cords fingers trembling uncontrollably rumbling knots Once sure
Harry bound tightly headstone couldnt
move inch Wormtail drew length black material
inside cloak stuffed roughly Harrys mouth
without word turned Harry hurried away Harry
couldnt make sound could see Wormtail gone
couldnt turn head see beyond headstone could
see right front Cedrics body
lying twenty feet away Some way beyond glinting
starlight lay Triwizard Cup Harrys wand ground
Cedrics feet The bundle robes Harry thought
baby close foot grave
It seemed stirring fretfully Harry watched scar
seared pain suddenly knew
didnt want see robes
didnt want bundle opened He could hear noises
feet He looked saw gigantic snake slithering
grass circling headstone tied Wormtails fast wheezy
breathing growing louder It sounded though forcing
something heavy across ground Then came back within Harrys range
vision Harry saw pushing stone cauldron
foot grave It full seemed
water Harry could hear slopping around
larger cauldron Harry ever used great stone belly
large enough fullgrown man sit The thing
inside bundle robes ground stirring persistently
though trying free Now Wormtail busying
bottom cauldron wand Suddenly
crackling names beneath The large snake slithered away darkness
The liquid cauldron seemed heat fast The
surface began bubble send fiery sparks
though fire Steam thickening blurring outline
Wormtail tending fire The movements beneath robes became
agitated And Harry heard high cold voice Hurry
The whole surface water alight sparks It
might encrusted diamonds It ready Master
Now said cold voice Wormtail pulled open robes
ground revealing inside Harry let
yell strangled wad material blocking
mouth It though Wormtail flipped stone
revealed something ugly slimy blind worse hundred
times worse The thing Wormtail carrying shape
crouched human child except Harry never seen anything less
like child It hairless scalylooking dark raw reddish
black Its arms legs thin feeble face
child alive ever face like flat
snakelike gleaming red eyes The thing seemed almost helpless
raised thin arms put around Wormtails neck Wormtail
lifted As hood fell back Harry
saw look revulsion Wormtails weak pale face
firelight carried creature rim cauldron
For one moment Harry saw evil flat face illuminated
sparks dancing surface potion And Wormtail lowered
creature cauldron hiss vanished
surface Harry heard frail body hit bottom
soft thud Let drown Harry thought scar burning almost
past endurance please let drown
Wormtail speaking His voice shook seemed frightened beyond wits
He raised wand closed eyes spoke night
Bone father unknowingly given wil lrenew son
The surface grave Harrys feet cracked Horrified Harry
watched fine trickle dust rose air
Wormtails command fell softly cauldron The diamond surface
water broke hissed sent sparks directions
turned vivid poisonouslooking blue And Wormtail whimpering He
pulled long thin shining silver dagger inside cloak His
voice broke petrified sobs Flesh servant
wwillingly given revive master
He stretched right hand front
hand missing finger He gripped dagger tightly
left hand swung upward Harry realized Wormtail
second happened closed
eyes tightly could could block
scream pierced night went Harry though
stabbed dagger He heard something fall
ground heard Wormtails anguished panting sickening splash
something dropped cauldron Harry couldnt stand look
potion turned burning red
light shone Harrys closed eyelids
Wormtail gasping moaning agony Not Harry felt Wormtails
anguished breath face realize Wormtail right
front Bblood enemy
forcibly taken resurrect foe
Harry could nothing prevent tied tightly
Squinting struggling hopelessly ropes binding
saw shining silver dagger shaking Wormtails remaining hand He felt
point penetrate crook right arm blood seeping
sleeve torn robes Wormtail still panting pain rumbled
pocket glass vial held Harrys
cut dribble blood fell He
staggered back cauldron Harrys blood He poured inside
The liquid within turned instantly blinding white Wormtail job done
dropped knees beside cauldron slumped sideways lay
ground cradling bleeding stump arm gasping
sobbing The cauldron simmering sending diamond sparks
directions blindingly bright turned else velvety
blackness Nothing happened Let drowned Harry
thought let gone wrong And
suddenly sparks emanating cauldron extinguished A surge
white steam billowed thickly cauldron instead obliterating everything front
Harry couldnt see Wormtail Cedric anything
vapor hanging air Its gone wrong thought
drowned please please let
dead But mist front
saw icy surge terror dark outline
man tall skeletally thin rising slowly inside
cauldron Robe said high cold voice behind
steam Wormtail sobbing moaning still cradling mutilated arm scrambled
pick black robes ground got
feet reached pulled onehanded masters head
The thin man stepped cauldron staring Harry
Harry stared back face haunted
nightmares three years Whiter skull wide livid
scarlet eyes nose flat snakes
slits nostrils Lord Voldemort risen
Voldemort looked away Harry began examining
body His hands like large pale spiders long white
fingers caressed chest arms face red eyes
whose pupils slits like cats gleamed still brightly
darkness He held hands flexed fingers
expression rapt exultant He took slightest notice Wormtail
lay twitching bleeding ground great
snake slithered back sight circling Harry
hissing Voldemort slipped one unnaturally longfingered hands deep
pocket drew wand He caressed gently
raised pointed Wormtail lifted
ground thrown headstone Harry tied
fell foot lay crumpled
crying Voldemort turned scarlet eyes upon Harry laughing high
cold mirthless laugh Wormtails robes shining blood
wrapped stump arm My Lord
choked Lord promised
promise Hold arm
said Voldemort lazily Oh Master thank Master
He extended bleeding stump Voldemort laughed
The arm Wormtail Master please please
Voldemort bent pulled Wormtails left arm forced
sleeve Wormtails robes past elbow Harry saw something
upon skin something like vivid red tattoo
skull snake protruding mouth image
appeared sky Quidditch World Cup Dark
Mark Voldemort examined carefully ignoring Wormtails uncontrollable weeping It
back said softly noticed
shall see shall know He
pressed long white forefinger brand Wormtails arm
The scar Harry forehead seared sharp pain
Wormtail let fresh howl Voldemort removed fingers
Wormtails mark Harry saw turned jet black
A look cruel satisfaction face Voldemort straightened threw
back head stared around dark graveyard How
many brave enough return feel
whispered gleaming red eyes fixed upon stars And many
foolish enough stay away He began pace
Harry Wormtail eyes sweeping graveyard
After minute looked Harry
cruel smile twisting snakelike face You stand Harry

But look Harry My true family returns
The air suddenly full swishing cloaks Between
graves behind yew tree every shadowy space wizards Apparating
All hooded masked And one one
moved forward slowly cautiously though could hardly
believe eyes Voldemort stood silence waiting Then one
Death Eaters fell knees crawled toward Voldemort
kissed hem black robes Master

Voldemorts feet Master shrieked Master forgive Forgive us

molten silver hung shining wands wake Momentarily shapeless writhed
formed gleaming replica human hand
bright moonlight soared downward fixed upon Wormtails bleeding
wrist Wormtails sobbing stopped abruptly His breathing harsh ragged
raised head stared disbelief silver hand
attached seamlessly arm though wearing dazzling
glove He flexed shining fingers trembling picked small
twig ground crushed powder My Lord

army creatures fear He walked
Some Death Eaters passed silence
paused others spoke Macnair
destroying dangerous beasts Ministry Magic Wormtail tells

murmured Macnair And Voldemort moved two
largest hooded figures Crabbe
better time Crabbe And Goyle
They bowed clumsily muttering dully Yes Master We

walked past stooped figure Mr Goyles shadow
My Lord I prostrate I

largest gap stood surveying
blank red eyes though could see people standing
And six missing Death Eaters three
dead service One cowardly return
pay One I believe left forever
killed course one remains
faithful servant already reentered service The
Death Eaters stirred Harry saw eyes dart sideways one
another masks He Hogwarts faithful servant
efforts young friend arrived
tonight Yes said Voldemort grin curling
lipless mouth eyes circle flashed Harrys direction
Harry Potter kindly joined us rebirthing party One might
go far call guest honor
There silence Then Death Eater right
Wormtail stepped forward Lucius Malfoys voice spoke mask
Master crave know beg tell

Ah story Lucius said Voldemort And
begins ends young friend
He walked lazily stand next Harry
eyes whole circle upon two The
snake continued circle You know course
called boy downfall Voldemort said softly red eyes upon
Harry whose scar began burn fiercely almost screamed
agony You know night I lost
powers body I tried kill His mother died
attempt save unwittingly provided
protection I admit I foreseen I could
touch boy Voldemort raised one long white fingers
put close Harrys cheek His mother left
upon traces sacrifice This old
magic I remembered I foolish overlook
matter I touch Harry felt cold
tip long white finger touch thought head
would burst pain Voldemort laughed softly ear
took finger away continued addressing Death Eaters I
miscalculated friends I admit My curse deflected
womans foolish sacrifice rebounded upon Aaah
pain beyond pain friends nothing could prepared
I ripped body I less spirit less
meanest ghost still I alive What
I even I know I gone
anybody along path leads immortality You know
goal conquer death And I tested
appeared one experiments worked
I killed though curse done
Nevertheless I powerless weakest creature alive without
means help I body every
spell might helped required use wand
I remember forcing sleeplessly endlessly second
second exist I settled faraway place
forest I waited Surely one
faithful Death Eaters would try find one
would come perform magic I could
restore body I waited
vain The shiver ran around circle
listening Death Eaters Voldemort let silence spiral horribly continuing
Only one power remained I could possess bodies
others But I dared go humans plentiful
I knew Aurors still abroad searching
I sometimes inhabited animals snakes course preference
I little better inside pure
spirit bodies ill adapted perform magic
possession shortened lives none
lasted long Then four
years ago means return seemed assured
A wizard young foolish gullible wandered across path
forest I made home Oh seemed
chance I dreaming teacher
Dumbledores school easy bend
brought back country I
took possession body supervise closely carried
orders But plan failed I manage
steal Sorcerers Stone I assured immortal life
I thwarted thwarted Harry Potter
Silence nothing stirring even leaves
yew tree The Death Eaters quite motionless glittering
eyes masks fixed upon Voldemort upon Harry The
servant died I left body I left
weak ever I Voldemort continued I returned
hiding place far away I pretend
I didnt fear I might never regain powers
Yes perhaps darkest hour I could
hope I would sent another wizard possess
I given hope
Death Eaters cared become One
two masked wizards circle moved uncomfortably Voldemort
took notice And even year ago
I almost abandoned hope happened last servant
returned Wormtail faked death
escape justice driven hiding
counted friends decided return master He sought
country long rumored I hiding
helped course rats met
along way Wormtail curious affinity rats
Wormtail His filthy little friends told place
deep Albanian forest avoided small animals like
met deaths dark shadow possessed
But journey back
smooth Wormtail For hungry one night edge
forest hoped find foolishly
stopped inn food
meet one Bertha Jorkins witch
Ministry Magic Now see way fate favors Lord
Voldemort This might end Wormtail
last hope regeneration But Wormtail displaying presence mind
I would never expected convinced Bertha Jorkins
accompany nighttime stroll He overpowered brought
And Bertha Jorkins might ruined proved
instead gift beyond wildest dreams
little persuasion became veritable mine information
She told Triwizard Tournament would played Hogwarts
year She told knew faithful Death
Eater would willing help I
could contact She told many things
means I used break Memory Charm upon
powerful I extracted useful information
mind body damaged beyond repair She served
purpose I could possess I disposed
Voldemort smiled terrible smile red eyes blank pitiless
Wormtails body course ill adapted possession assumed
dead would attract far much attention noticed However
ablebodied servant I needed poor wizard though
Wormtail able follow instructions I gave
would return rudimentary weak body
body I would able inhabit awaiting essential ingredients
true rebirth spell two invention
little help dear Nagini Voldemorts red eyes fell
upon continually circling snake potion concocted unicorn blood
snake venom Nagini provided I soon returned
almost human form strong enough travel There
hope stealing Sorcerers Stone anymore I knew Dumbledore
would seen destroyed But I
willing embrace mortal life chasing immortality I set
sights lower I would settle old body back
old strength I knew achieve
old piece Dark Magic potion revived
tonight I would need three powerful ingredients Well one
already hand Wormtail Flesh given
servant My fathers bone naturally meant
would come buried But
blood foe Wormtail would use
wizard would Wormtail Any wizard hated
many still But I knew one
I must use I rise powerful
I I fallen I wanted Harry Potters
blood I wanted blood one stripped
power thirteen years ago lingering protection
mother gave would reside veins
But get Harry Potter For
better protected I think even knows protected
ways devised Dumbledore long ago fell
arrange boys future Dumbledore invoked ancient magic ensure
boys protection long relations care
Not even I touch Then
course Quidditch World Cup I thought protection
might weaker away relations Dumbledore I
yet strong enough attempt kidnap midst
horde Ministry wizards And boy would return
Hogwarts crooked nose Muggleloving fool
morning night So could I take Why
using Bertha Jorkinss information course Use one faithful
Death Eater stationed Hogwarts ensure boys name
entered Goblet Fire Use Death Eater ensure
boy tournament touched Triwizard
Cup first cup Death Eater turned
Portkey would bring beyond reach Dumbledores
help protection waiting arms And
boy believed downfall
Voldemort moved slowly forward turned face Harry He raised
wand Crucio It pain beyond anything Harry ever
experienced bones fire head surely splitting
along scar eyes rolling madly head
wanted end black die
And gone He hanging limply ropes
binding headstone Voldemorts father looking
bright red eyes kind mist The night ringing
sound Death Eaters laughter You see I
think foolish suppose boy could ever
stronger said Voldemort But I want
mistake anybodys mind Harry Potter escaped
lucky chance And I going prove power
killing front
Dumbledore help mother die
I give chance He allowed
fight left doubt
us stronger Just little longer Nagini whispered
snake glided away grass Death Eaters
stood watching Now untie Wormtail give back wand
Wormtail approached Harry scrambled find
feet support weight ropes untied Wormtail
raised new silver hand pulled wad material gagging
Harry one swipe cut bonds tying Harry
gravestone There split second perhaps Harry
might considered running injured leg shook
stood overgrown grave Death Eaters
closed ranks forming tighter circle around Voldemort
gaps missing Death Eaters stood filled
Wormtail walked circle place Cedrics body
lay returned Harrys wand thrust roughly Harrys
hand without looking Then Wormtail resumed place
circle watching Death Eaters You taught
duel Harry Potter said Voldemort softly red eyes glinting
darkness At words Harry remembered though former
life dueling club Hogwarts attended briefly two years
ago All learned Disarming Spell Expelliarmus
use would deprive Voldemort
wand even could surrounded Death
Eaters outnumbered least thirty one He never learned
anything could possibly fit He knew
facing thing Moody always warned
unblockable Avada Kedavra curse Voldemort right
mother die time He
quite unprotected We bow
Harry said Voldemort bending little keeping snakelike face upturned
Harry Come niceties must observed Dumbledore
would like show manners Bow
death Harry The Death Eaters laughing Voldemorts lipless
mouth smiling Harry bow He going
let Voldemort play killing
going give satisfaction I said
bow Voldemort said raising wand Harry felt spine
curve though huge invisible hand bending ruthlessly forward
Death Eaters laughed harder ever Very good said
Voldemort softly raised wand pressure bearing
upon Harry lifted And face like man
straightbacked proud way father died
And duel Voldemort raised
wand Harry could anything defend
could even move hit Cruciatus Curse
The pain intense allconsuming longer knew
Whitehot knives piercing every inch
skin head surely going burst pain
screaming loudly hed ever screamed life
And stopped Harry rolled scrambled feet
shaking uncontrollably Wormtail done hand
cut staggered sideways wall watching
Death Eaters pushed away back toward Voldemort A
little break said Voldemort slitlike nostrils dilating excitement little
pause That hurt didnt Harry You dont want
Harry didnt answer He
going die like Cedric pitiless red eyes telling
going die nothing
could wasnt going play along
He wasnt going obey Voldemort wasnt going beg
I asked whether want
said Voldemort softly Answer Imperial And Harry
felt third time life sensation
mind wiped thought Ah
bliss think though floating
dreaming answer say answer
I said stronger voice back
head I wont answer Just answer
I wont I wont say
Just answer I WONT
And words burst Harrys mouth echoed
graveyard dream state lifted suddenly though cold
water thrown back rushed aches
Cruciatus Curse left body back rushed
realization facing
You wont said Voldemort quietly Death Eaters
laughing You wont say Harry obedience
virtue I need teach die
Perhaps another little dose pain Voldemort raised wand
time Harry ready reflexes born
Quidditch training flung sideways onto ground rolled behind
marble headstone Voldemort father heard crack
curse missed We playing hideandseek Harry
said Voldemorts soft cold voice drawing nearer Death Eaters laughed
You cannot hide Does mean tired
duel Does mean would prefer finish
Harry Come Harry come
play quick might even
painless I would know I never died
Harry crouched behind headstone knew end
come There hope help
And heard Voldemort draw nearer still knew one thing
beyond fear reason He going
die crouching like child playing hideandseek
going die kneeling Voldemort feet going
die upright like father going die trying
defend even defense possible
Before Voldemort could stick snakelike face around headstone Harry
stood gripped wand tightly hand
thrust front threw around
headstone facing Voldemort Voldemort ready As Harry shouted Expelliarmus Voldemort

Dobby following right moment As thought
occurred wheeled around stared back Privet Drive
appeared completely deserted Harry sure Dobby
know become invisible He walked
hardly aware route taking pounded
streets often lately feet carried
favourite haunts automatically Every steps glanced back shoulder
Someone magical near lay among Aunt Petunias
dying begonias sure Why hadnt spoken
hadnt made contact hiding
And feeling frustration peaked certainty
leaked away Perhaps hadnt magical sound
Perhaps desperate tiniest sign
contact world belonged simply
overreacting perfectly ordinary noises Could sure hadnt
sound something breaking inside neighbours house
Harry felt dull sinking sensation stomach
knew feeling hopelessness plagued summer
rolled Tomorrow morning would
woken alarm five oclock could pay
owl delivered Daily Prophet
point continuing take Harry merely glanced front page
throwing aside days idiots ran
paper finally realised Voldemort back would headline news
kind Harry cared
If lucky would also owls carrying letters
best friends Ron Hermione though expectation hed
letters would bring news long since dashed
We cant say much youknowwhat obviously
Weve told say anything important case letters go
astray Were quite busy I cant give
details Theres fair amount going well
tell everything see
But going see Nobody seemed
bothered precise date Hermione scribbled I expect well
seeing quite soon inside birthday card soon
soon As far Harry could tell vague hints
letters Hermione Ron place presumably
Rons parents house He could hardly bear think pair
fun The Burrow stuck
Privet Drive In fact angry
thrown away unopened two boxes Honeydukes chocolates theyd sent
birthday Hed regretted later wilted salad Aunt
Petunia provided dinner night And
Ron Hermione busy Why wasnt Harry busy Hadnt
proved capable handling much Had
forgotten done Hadnt
entered graveyard watched Cedric murdered tied
tombstone nearly killed Dont think
Harry told sternly hundredth time summer It
bad enough kept revisiting graveyard nightmares without
dwelling waking moments He
turned corner Magnolia Crescent halfway along passed narrow
alleyway side garage first clapped
eyes godfather Sirius least seemed understand Harry
feeling Admittedly letters empty proper news
Ron Hermiones least contained words caution
consolation instead tantalising hints I know must frustrating
Keep nose clean everything
OK Be careful dont anything rash
Well thought Harry crossed Magnolia
Crescent turned Magnolia Road headed towards darkening play park
large done Sirius advised He
least resisted temptation tie trunk broomstick

behaviour good considering frustrated angry felt
stuck Privet Drive long reduced hiding
flowerbeds hope hearing something might point
Lord Voldemort Nevertheless quite galling told
rash man served twelve years

locked park gate set across parched grass The park
empty surrounding streets When reached swings

fresh way listening news In meantime
nothing look forward another restless disturbed night
even escaped nightmares Cedric unsettling
dreams long dark corridors finishing dead ends locked
doors supposed something trapped feeling
awake Often old scar
forehead prickled uncomfortably fool Ron
Hermione Sirius would find interesting In
past scar hurting warned Voldemort getting stronger
Voldemort back would probably remind
regular irritation expected nothing
worry old news
The injustice welled inside
wanted yell fury If hadnt
nobody would even known Voldemort back And reward
stuck Little Whinging four solid weeks completely
cut magical world reduced squatting among dying begonias
hat could hear waterskiing budgerigars How could Dumbledore
forgotten easily Why Ron Hermione got together without inviting

though happiness gone world
I remembered dreadful things
Her voice shook died Madam Boness eyes
widened slightly Harry could see red marks eyebrow
monocle dug What Dementors

They went boys said Mrs Figg voice stronger
confident pink flush ebbing away face
One fallen The backing away trying

one away cousin And
happened Mrs Figg finished somewhat lamely Madam Bones
looked Mrs Figg silence Fudge looking
fidgeting papers Finally raised
eyes said rather aggressively Thats saw
That happened Mrs Figg repeated
Very well said Fudge You may go Mrs Figg
cast frightened look Fudge Dumbledore got
shuffled towards door Harry heard thud shut behind
Not convincing witness said Fudge loftily
Oh I dont know said Madam Bones booming
voice She certainly described effects Dementor attack accurately And
I cant imagine would say
werent But Dementors wandering Muggle suburb
happening come across wizard snorted Fudge The odds
must long Even Bagman wouldnt bet
Oh I dont think us believe
Dementors coincidence said Dumbledore lightly
The witch sitting right Fudge face
shade w moved slightly everyone else quite still silent
And supposed mean Fudge asked
icily It means I think ordered
said Dumbledore I think might
record someone ordered pair Dementors
go strolling Little Whinging barked Fudge Not
Dementors taking orders someone Ministry
Magic days said Dumbledore calmly I already given
views matter Cornelius Yes said
Fudge forcefully I reason believe views
anything bilge Dumbledore The Dementors remain place
Azkaban everything ask
Then said Dumbledore quietly clearly must ask somebody
within Ministry ordered pair Dementors alleyway
second August In complete silence
greeted words witch right Fudge leaned forwards
Harry saw first time
He thought looked like large pale toad She
rather squat broad flabby face little neck Uncle
Vernon wide slack mouth Her eyes large round
slightly bulging Even little black velvet bow perched top
short curly hair put mind large
fly catch long sticky tongue
The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge Senior Undersecretary
Minister said Fudge The witch spoke fluttery
girlish highpitched voice took Harry aback expecting
croak Im sure I must misunderstood Professor
Dumbledore said simper felt big round eyes
cold ever So silly But sounded
teensy moment though suggesting Ministry
Magic ordered attack boy She
gave silvery laugh made hairs back
Harrys neck stand A members Wizengamot laughed
It could plainer one
really amused If true
Dementors taking orders Ministry Magic
also true two Dementors attacked Harry cousin
week ago follows logically somebody Ministry
might ordered attacks said Dumbledore politely Of course particular
Dementors may outside Ministry control
There Dementors outside Ministry control snapped Fudge turned
brick red Dumbledore inclined head little
bow Then undoubtedly Ministry making
full inquiry two Dementors far Azkaban
attacked without authorisation It
decide Ministry Magic
Dumbledore snapped Fudge shade magenta
Uncle Vernon would proud Of course

matter go uninvestigated He glanced Madam
Bones readjusted monocle stared back frowning slightly
I would remind everybody behaviour

presence Dementors alleyway highly relevant Clause Seven
Decree states magic may used Muggles
exceptional circumstances exceptional circumstances include situations threaten
life wizard witch witches
wizards Muggles present time
We familiar Clause Seven thank much
snarled Fudge Of course said Dumbledore courteously
Then agreement Harrys use Patronus Charm
circumstances falls precisely category exceptional circumstances
clause describes If Dementors I doubt
You heard eyewitness Dumbledore interrupted
If still doubt truthfulness call back
question I sure would object
I blustered Fudge fiddling

Harry quietly It saved life June Smith
opened mouth stupidly The rest room quiet
But think beneath
leave Harry said Smith move Nor
anybody else OK said Harry mouth slightly drier
usual eyes upon I reckon
divide pairs practise It felt
odd issuing instructions nearly odd seeing
followed Everybody got feet divided
Predictably Neville left partnerless You practise
Harry told Right count three
one two three The room
suddenly full shouts Expelliarmus Wands flew directions missed
spells hit books shelves sent flying air
Harry quick Neville whose wand went spinning
hand hit ceiling shower sparks landed
clatter top bookshelf Harry retrieved
Summoning Charm Glancing around thought
right suggest practise basics first lot
shoddy spellwork going many people succeeding Disarming
opponents merely causing jump backwards
paces wince feeble spell whooshed
Expelliarmus said Neville Harry caught unawares tell wand
fly hand I DID IT said
Neville gleefully Ive never done I DID IT
Good one said Harry encouragingly deciding point
real duel Nevilles opponent unlikely staring
opposite direction wand held loosely side
Listen Neville take turns practise Ron
Hermione couple minutes I walk around

middle room Something odd happening
Zacharias Smith Every time opened mouth disarm Anthony
Goldstein wand would fly hand yet Anthony
seem making sound Harry
look far solve mystery Fred George several
feet Smith taking turns point wands
back Sorry Harry said George hastily
Harry caught eye Couldnt resist Harry walked around
pairs trying correct spell
wrong Ginny teamed Michael Corner well
whereas Michael either bad unwilling jinx Ernie
Macmillan flourishing wand unnecessarily giving partner time get
guard Creevey brothers enthusiastic erratic
mainly responsible books leaping shelves around
Luna Lovegood similarly patchy occasionally sending Justin FinchFletchleys wand spinning
hand times merely causing hair stand
end OK stop Harry shouted Stop STOP
I need whistle thought immediately spotted one
lying top nearest row books He caught
blew hard Everyone lowered wands That
wasnt bad said Harry theres definite room improvement Zacharias Smith
glared Lets try He moved
around room stopping make suggestions Slowly
general performance improved He avoided going near Cho
friend walking twice around every
pair room felt could ignore
longer Oh said Cho rather wildly
approached Expelliarmious I mean Expellimellius I oh sorry Marietta
Her curlyhaired friends sleeve caught fire Marietta extinguished
wand glared Harry though
fault You made nervous I
right Cho told Harry ruefully That
quite good Harry lied raised eyebrows said
Well lousy I know

Her friend Marietta looked rather sourly turned away
Dont mind Cho muttered She doesnt really want
I made come Her parents
forbidden anything might upset Umbridge You see
mum works Ministry What
parents asked Harry Well theyve forbidden get
wrong side Umbridge said Cho drawing
proudly But think Im going fight YouKnowWho

looking rather confused awkward silence fell Terry Boots
wand went whizzing past Harrys ear hit Alicia Spinnet hard

eavesdropping conversation Justin Finch Fletchley
attempted disentangle robes flown
head Hes always saying hed believe anything Fudge I mean

feeds anybody disagrees And theres Umgubular
Slashkilter Dont ask Harry muttered Cho
opened mouth looking puzzled She giggled
Hey Harry Hermione called end room

They argued way back common room Harry
listening He one eye Marauders
Map also thinking Cho saying made nervous
The Lion SerpantHarry felt though carrying
kind talisman inside chest following two weeks
glowing secret supported Umbridges classes even made
possible smile blandly looked horrible
bulging eyes He DA resisting
nose thing Ministry feared
whenever supposed reading Wilbert Slinkhards book
lessons dwelled instead satisfying memories recent meetings
remembering Neville successfully disarmed Hermione Colin Creevey mastered
Impediment Jinx three meetings hard effort Parvati Patil
produced good Reductor Curse reduced table
carrying Sneakoscopes dust He finding
almost impossible fix regular night week
DA meetings accommodate three separate teams Quidditch
practices often rearranged due bad weather conditions Harry
sorry feeling
probably better keep timing meetings unpredictable If anyone
watching would hard make pattern
Hermione soon devised clever method communicating
time date next meeting members
case needed change short notice
would look suspicious people different Houses seen crossing
Great Hall talk often She gave
members DA fake Galleon Ron became
excited first saw basket convinced
actually giving gold You see numerals around
edge coins Hermione said holding one examination
end fourth meeting The coin gleamed fat
yellow light torches On real Galleons thats
serial number referring goblin cast coin On
fake coins though numbers change reflect time
date next meeting The coins grow hot
date changes youre carrying pocket youll
able feel We take one Harry
sets date next meeting hell change numbers
coin Ive put Protean Charm theyll
change mimic A blank silence greeted
Hermiones words She looked around faces upturned
rather disconcerted Well I thought
good idea said uncertainly I mean even Umbridge asked us
turn pockets theres nothing fishy carrying Galleon
But well dont want
use You Protean
Charm said Terry Boot Yes said Hermione
But thats thats NEWT standard
said weakly Oh said Hermione trying look modest
Oh well yes I suppose
How come youre Ravenclaw demanded
staring Hermione something close wonder With brains like
Well Sorting Hat seriously consider putting
Ravenclaw Sorting said Hermione brightly decided
Gryffindor end So mean using Galleons
There murmur assent everybody moved
forwards collect one basket Harry looked sideways Hermione
You know remind
No whats The Death Eaters scars Voldemort
touches one scars burn know
theyve got join Well
yes said Hermione quietly I got idea
youll notice I decided engrave date
bits metal rather members skin

slipped Galleon pocket I suppose danger
might accidentally spend
Fat chance said Ron examining fake Galleon
slightly mournful air I havent got real Galleons confuse
As first Quidditch match

Naturally naturally murmured Dumbledore apparently still observing stream
smoke without slightest sign surprise But essence divided
Harry could make neither head tail
question The smoke serpent however split instantly two snakes
coiling undulating dark air With look grim
satisfaction Dumbledore gave instrument another gentle tap hs wand
clinking noise slowed died smoke serpents grew faint became
formless haze vanished Dumbledore replaced instrument

I would also advise Transfiguration Aurors frequently need
Transfigure Untransfigure work And I ought tell
Potter I accept students NEWT

The Lost ProphecyHarrys feet hit solid ground knees buckled little
golden wizards head fell resounding clunk
floor He looked around saw arrived Dumbledores
office Everything seemed repaired
Headmasters absence The delicate silver instruments stood spindlelegged
tables puffing whirring serenely The portraits headmasters headmistresses
snoozing frames heads lolling back armchairs
edge picture Harry looked window There
cool line pale green along horizon dawn approaching
The silence stillness broken
occasional grunt snuffle sleeping portrait unbearable
If surroundings could reflected feelings inside pictures
would screaming pain He walked around quiet beautiful
office breathing quickly trying think But think
escape
It fault Sirius died

Ah Harry Potter
Phineas Nigellus gave long yawn stretching arms surveyed
Harry shrewd narrow eyes And brings
early hours morning said Phineas eventually
This office supposed barred rightful
Headmaster Or Dumbledore sent Oh dont tell
He gave another shuddering yawn Another message worthless
greatgreatgrandson Harry could speak Phineas Nigellus
know Sirius dead Harry could tell To
say aloud would make final absolute irretrievable
A portraits stirred Terror
interrogated made Harry stride across room seize
doorknob It would turn He shut
I hope means said corpulent rednosed wizard
hung wall behind Headmasters desk Dumbledore
soon back among us Harry turned The wizard
surveying great interest Harry nodded He tugged
doorknob behind back remained immovable
Oh good said wizard It dull without

chair painted smiled benignly upon Harry
Dumbledore thinks highly I
sure know said comfortably Oh yes Holds great
esteem The guilt filling whole Harrys chest
like monstrous weighty parasite writhed squirmed Harry could
stand could stand
never felt trapped inside head
body never wished intensely could somebody anybody else
The empty fireplace burst emerald
green flame making Harry leap away door staring
man spinning inside grate As Dumbledores tall form unfolded
fire wizards witches surrounding walls jerked awake
many giving cries welcome Thank

Dumbledore reminding amount damage
caused although Dumbledore looking
directly although expression kindly rather accusatory Harry could
bear meet eyes Madam Pomfrey
patching everybody said Dumbledore Nymphadora Tonks may need spend
little time St Mungos seems make
full recovery Harry contented nodding
carpet growing lighter sky outside grew paler He
sure portraits around room listening closely

Dumbledore stared determinedly window He could see
Quidditch stadium distance Sirius appeared disguised
shaggy black dog could watch Harry play

repeated If dont keep

I DONT CARE WHAT YOUVE GOT TO SAY Harry roared
I dont want hear anything youve got say
You said Dumbledore steadily Because nearly
angry ought If
attack I know close I would
like thoroughly earned What
talking It fault Sirius
died said Dumbledore clearly Or I say almost entirely fault
I arrogant claim responsibility
whole Sirius brave clever energetic man
men usually content sit home hiding
believe others danger Nevertheless never
believed instant necessity
go Department Mysteries tonight If I open
Harry I would known
long time ago Voldemort might try lure
Department Mysteries would never tricked
going tonight And Sirius would come
That blame lies alone
Harry still standing hand doorknob
unaware He gazing Dumbledore hardly breathing listening
yet barely understanding hearing Please sit
said Dumbledore It order request
Harry hesitated walked slowly across room
littered silver cogs fragments wood took seat
facing Dumbledores desk Am I understand said Phineas
Nigellus slowly Harrys left greatgreatgrandson last
Blacks dead Yes Phineas said Dumbledore
I dont believe said Phineas brusquely
Harry turned head time see Phineas marching
portrait knew gone visit
painting Grimmauld Place He would walk perhaps portrait
portrait calling Sirius house
Harry I owe explanation said Dumbledore An explanation
old mans mistakes For I see I
done done regard bears hallmarks
failings age Youth cannot know age thinks
feels But old men guilty forget
young I seem forgotten
lately The sun rising properly
rim dazzling orange visible mountains
sky colourless bright The light fell
upon Dumbledore upon silver eyebrows beard upon
lines gouged deeply lace I guessed fifteen
years ago said Dumbledore I saw scar forehead
might mean I guessed might sign
connection forged Voldemort Youve
told Professor said Harry bluntly He care
rude He care anything much
Yes said Dumbledore apologetically Yes see
necessary start scar For became
apparent shortly rejoined magical world I correct
scar giving warnings Voldemort close
else feeling powerful emotion I know
said Harry wearily And ability
detect Voldemorts presence even disguised know
feeling emotions roused become
pronounced since Voldemort returned body
full powers Harry bother nod
He knew already More recently said
Dumbledore I became concerned Voldemort might realise connection
exists Sure enough came time entered
far mind thoughts sensed presence I
speaking course night witnessed attack
Mr Weasley Yeah Snape told Harry muttered
Professor Snape Harry Dumbledore corrected quietly But
wonder I explained
Why I teach Occlumency Why I
much looked months Harry looked
He could see Dumbledore looked sad tired
Yeah Harry mumbled Yeah I wondered You
see Dumbledore continued I believed could long Voldemort
attempted force way mind manipulate misdirect
thoughts I eager give incentives
I sure realised
relationship ever closer
headmaster pupil would seize chance use
means spy I feared uses
would put possibility might try possess
Harry I believe I right think Voldemort would
made use way On rare
occasions close contact I thought I saw shadow
stir behind eyes
Harry remembered feeling dormant snake risen
ready strike moments Dumbledore made
eyecontact Voldemorts aim possessing demonstrated
tonight would destruction It would
He hoped possessed briefly short ago
I would sacrifice hope killing So
see I trying distancing protect
Harry An old man mistake
He sighed deeply Harry letting words wash
He would interested know
months ago meaningless compared gaping chasm
inside loss Sirius none mattered
Sirius told felt Voldemort
awake inside night vision
Arthur Weasleys attack I knew worst fears
correct Voldemort realised could use In attempt
arm Voldemort assaults mind I arranged Occlumency
lessons Professor Snape He paused Harry watched
sunlight sliding slowly across polished surface Dumbledores desk
illuminate silver ink pot handsome scarlet quill Harry could
tell portraits around awake listening raptly
Dumbledores explanation could hear occasional rustle robes
slight clearing throat Phineas Nigellus still returned
Professor Snape discovered Dumbledore resumed
dreaming door Department Mysteries
months Voldemort course obsessed possibility hearing
prophecy ever since regained body dwelled
door though
meant And saw Rookwood worked
Department Mysteries arrest telling Voldemort
known along prophecies held Ministry
Magic heavily protected Only people
refer lilt shelves without suffering madness
case either Voldemort would enter Ministry
Magic risk revealing last else
would take It became matter
even greater urgency master Occlumency But
I didnt muttered Harry He said aloud try ease
dead weight guilt inside confession must surely relieve
terrible pressure squeezing heart I didnt practise I
didnt bother I couldve stopped dreams Hermione kept telling
I hed never able
show go Sirius wouldnt Sirius
wouldnt Something erupting inside Harrys head
need justify explain
I tried check hed really taken Sirius I went Umbridges
office I spoke Kreacher fire said Sirius
wasnt said hed gone Kreacher lied said
Dumbledore calmly You master could lie
without even needing punish Kreacher intended go
Ministry Magic He sent
purpose Oh yes Kreacher I afraid
serving one master months How
said Harry blankly He hasnt Grimmauld Place years
Kreacher seized opportunity shortly Christmas said Dumbledore
Sirius apparently shouted get He took Sirius
word interpreted order leave
house He went Black family member
respect left Blacks cousin Narcissa sister
Bellatrix wife Lucius Malfoy How
know Harry said His heart beating fast He
felt sick He remembered worrying Kreachers odd absence Christmas remembered
turning attic
Kreacher told last night said Dumbledore You see
gave Professor Snape cryptic warning realised
vision Sirius trapped bowels
Department Mysteries He like attempted contact Sirius
I explain members Order Phoenix
reliable methods communicating fire Dolores Umbridges
office Professor Snape found Sirius alive safe Grimmauld
Place When however return
trip Forest Dolores Umbridge Professor Snape grew worried
still believed Sirius captive Lord Voldemorts He
alerted certain Order members Dumbledore heaved
great sigh continued Alastor Moody Nymphadora Tonks Kingsley Shacklebolt Remus
Lupin Headquarters made contact All agreed go
aid Professor Snape requested Sirius remain behind
needed somebody remain Headquarters tell
happened I due moment In
meantime Professor Snape intended search Forest
But Sirius wish remain behind
others went search He delegated Kreacher task
telling happened And
I arrived Grimmauld Place shortly left
Ministry elf told laughing fit
burst Sirius gone He
laughing said Harry hollow voice Oh yes
said Dumbledore You see Kreacher able betray us totally
He Secret Keeper Order could give
Malfoys whereabouts tell Orders confidential plans
forbidden reveal He bound
enchantments kind say could
disobey direct order master Sirius But gave Narcissa
information sort valuable lo Voldemort yet must
seemed much trivial Sirius think banning
repeating Like said Harry
Like fact person Sirius cared
world said Dumbledore quietly Like fact
coming regard Sirius mixture father brother
Voldemort knew already course Sirius
Order knew Kreachers
information made realise one person would
go lengths rescue Sirius Black
Harrys lips cold numb So
I asked Kreacher Sirius last night
The Malfoys undoubtedly Voldemorts instructions
told must find way keeping Sirius
way seen vision Sirius
tortured Then decided check whether Sirius
home Kreacher would able pretend
Kreacher injured Buckbeak Hippogriff yesterday moment
made appearance fire Sirius upstairs tending
There seemed little air Harrys
lungs breathing quick shallow And Kreacher
told laughed croaked
He wish tell said Dumbledore But
I sufficiently accomplished Legilimens know I
lied I persuaded tell
full story I left Department Mysteries
And whispered Harry hands curled cold fists
knees Hermione kept telling us nice
She quite right Harry said Dumbledore
I warned Sirius adopted twelve Grimmauld Place Headquarters
Kreacher must treated kindness respect I also told
Kreacher could dangerous us I think
Sirius took seriously ever saw Kreacher
feelings acute humans
Dont blame dont talk
Sirius like Harrys breath constricted could get
words properly rage subsided briefly flared
would let Dumbledore criticise Sirius Kreachers
lying foul deserved Kreacher
made wizards Harry said Dumbledore Yes
pitied His existence miserable
friend Dobbys He forced Siriuss bidding Sirius
last family enslaved
felt true loyalty And whatever Kreachers faults
must admitted Sirius nothing make Kreachers lot easier
DONT TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT Harry
yelled He feet furious ready
fly Dumbledore plainly understood Sirius
brave much suffered
What Snape Harry spat Youre talking
When I told Voldemort Sirius
sneered usual Harry
know Professor Snape choice pretend take
seriously front Dolores Umbridge said Dumbledore steadily
I explained informed Order soon possible
said It deduced
gone return Forest It
gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum attempting
force tell Siriuss whereabouts Harry disregarded
felt savage pleasure blaming Snape seemed
easing sense dreadful guilt wanted
hear Dumbledore agree Snape Snape g
goaded Sirius staying house made
Sirius coward Sirius much
old clever allowed feeble taunts hurt
said Dumbledore Snape stopped giving Occlumency lessons
Harry snarled He threw office
I aware said Dumbledore heavily I already said
mistake teach
though I sure time nothing could
dangerous open mind even Voldemort
presence Snape made worse
scar always hurt worse lessons Harry
remembered Rons thoughts subject plunged
know wasnt trying soften Voldemort make
easier get inside
I trust Severus Snape said Dumbledore simply But I forgot
another old mans mistake wounds run deep
healing I thought Professor Snape could overcome feelings
father I wrong But thats OK
yelled Harry ignoring scandalised faces disapproving mutterings
portraits walls Its OK Snape hate dad
OK Sirius hate Kreacher
Sirius hate Kreacher said Dumbledore He regarded
servant unworthy much interest notice Indifference neglect often
much damage outright dislike fountain
destroyed tonight told lie We wizards mistreated abused
fellows long reaping reward
SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT DID HE Harry yelled
I say ever
hear say Dumbledore replied quietly Sirius cruel
man kind house elves general He
love Kreacher Kreacher living reminder
home Sirius hated Yeah hate
said Harry voice cracking turning back Dumbledore walking
away The sun bright inside room eyes
portraits followed walked without realising
without seeing office You made
stay shut house hated thats

I trying keep Sirius alive said Dumbledore quietly
People dont like locked Harry said furiously rounding
You last summer
Dumbledore closed eyes buried face longfingered
hands Harry watched uncharacteristic sign exhaustion sadness
whatever Dumbledore soften On

He business weak Harry wanted rage
storm Dumbledore lowered hands surveyed
Harry halfmoon glasses It time
said tell I told
five years ago Harry Please sit I going tell
everything I ask little patience You
chance rage whatever like

Harry glared moment flung back
chair opposite Dumbledore waited Dumbledore stared
moment sunlit grounds outside window looked back
Harry said Five years ago arrived Hogwarts Harry
safe whole I planned intended Well
quite whole You suffered I knew would I left
aunt uncles doorstep I knew I condemning
ten dark difficult years He paused
Harry said nothing You might ask
good reason Why could
wizarding family taken Many would done
gladly would honoured delighted raise
son My answer priority
keep alive You danger perhaps
anyone I realised Voldemort vanquished hours
supporters many almost terrible
still large angry desperate violent And I
make decision regard years ahead Did
I believe Voldemort gone ever No I knew
whether would ten twenty fifty years returned
I sure would I sure
knowing I done would rest
killed I knew Voldemorts knowledge
magic perhaps extensive wizard alive I knew
even complex powerful protective spells charms
unlikely invincible ever returned full power
But I knew Voldemort weak And
I made decision You would protected ancient magic
knows despises always
therefore underestimated cost I speaking course
fact mother died save She gave
lingering protection never expected protection flows
veins day I put trust therefore mothers
blood I delivered sister remaining relative
She doesnt love said Harry She doesnt
give damn But took
Dumbledore cut across She may taken grudgingly furiously unwillingly
bitterly yet still took sealed
charm I placed upon Your mothers sacrifice made bond
blood strongest shield I could give
I still dont While still
call home place mothers blood dwells cannot
touched harmed Voldemort He shed blood
lives sister Her blood became refuge
You need return year long

Harry waited Dumbledore speak
I still dont understand Voldemort tried kill
child prophecy made shortly
birth He knew prophecy made though
know full contents He set kill
still baby believing fulfilling terms
prophecy He discovered cost mistaken
curse intended kill backfired And since return
body particularly since extraordinary escape last
year determined hear prophecy entirety
This weapon seeking assiduously since
return knowledge destroy The
sun risen fully Dumbledores office bathed The
glass case sword Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white
opaque fragments instruments Harry thrown
floor glistened like raindrops behind baby Fawkes made soft
chirruping noises nest ashes The prophecys
smashed Harry said blankly I pulling Neville benches
room archway I ripped
robes fell The thing
smashed merely record prophecy kept
Department Mysteries But prophecy made somebody
person means recalling perfectly Who

greatgreatgranddaughter famous gifted Seer I thought
common politeness meet I disappointed It seemed
trace gift I
told courteously I hope I think would
suitable post I turned leave
Dumbledore got feet walked past Harry black
cabinet stood beside Fawkess perch He bent slid back
catch took inside shallow stone basin carved
runes around edges Harry seen father tormenting
Snape Dumbledore walked back desk placed Pensieve upon
raised wand temple From withdrew
silvery gossamerfine strands thought clinging wand deposited
basin He sat back behind desk watched
thoughts swirl drift inside Pensieve moment Then
sigh raised wand prodded silvery substance
tip A figure rose
draped shawls eyes magnified enormous size behind glasses
revolved slowly feet basin But Sybill
Trelawney spoke usual ethereal mystic voice
harsh hoarse tones Harry heard use
The one power vanquish Dark
Lord approaches born thrice defied
born seventh month dies
Dark Lord mark equal
power Dark Lord knows either must
die hand neither live
survives one power
vanquish Dark Lord born seventh month dies
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank
back silver mass vanished The silence
within office absolute Neither Dumbledore Harry
portraits made sound Even Fawkes fallen silent
Professor Dumbledore Harry said quietly Dumbledore still staring
Pensieve seemed completely lost thought It
mean mean
It meant said Dumbledore person chance
conquering Lord Voldemort good born end
July nearly sixteen years ago This boy would born parents
already defied Voldemort three times Harry felt
though something closing His breathing seemed difficult
It means Dumbledore
surveyed moment glasses The
odd thing Harry said softly may
meant Sybills prophecy could applied two wizard
boys born end July year
parents Order Phoenix sets
parents narrowly escaped Voldemort three times One course
The Neville Longbottom But
name prophecy
Nevilles The official record relabelled Voldemorts
attack child said Dumbledore It seemed plain
keeper Hall Prophecy Voldemort could
tried kill knew one
Sybill referring Then might
said Harry I afraid said
Dumbledore slowly looking though every word cost great effort
doubt
But said Neville born end July
mum dad
You forgetting next part prophecy final identifying
feature boy could vanquish Voldemort Voldemort
would mark equal And Harry
He chose Neville He gave scar
proved blessing curse But might
chosen wrong said Harry He might marked wrong person
He chose boy thought likely
danger said Dumbledore And notice Harry chose
pureblood according creed kind
wizard worth knowing halfblood like He
saw ever seen
marking scar kill
intended gave powers future fitted
escape four times far something
neither parents Nevilles parents ever achieved
Why said Harry felt numb
cold Why try kill baby He
waited see whether Neville I looked dangerous
older tried kill whoever
That might indeed
practical course said Dumbledore except Voldemorts information prophecy
incomplete The Hogs Head inn Sybill chose cheapness
long attracted shall say interesting clientele Three
Broomsticks As friends found cost
I mine night place
never safe assume overheard Of course I
dreamed I set meet Sybill Trelawney
I would hear anything worth overhearing My one stroke
good fortune eavesdropper detected short
way prophecy thrown building
So heard He heard
beginning part foretelling birth boy July
parents thrice defied Voldemort Consequently could warn
master attack would risk transferring power
marking equal So Voldemort never knew
might danger attacking might
wise wait learn He know
would power Dark Lord knows
But I dont said Harry strangled voice I havent
powers hasnt got I couldnt fight way
tonight I cant possess people kill
There room Department Mysteries
interrupted Dumbledore kept locked times It contains
force wonderful terrible death
human intelligence forces nature It also perhaps
mysterious many subjects study reside
It power held within room possess
quantities Voldemort That power took
save Sirius tonight That power also saved possession
Voldemort could bear reside body
full force detests In end mattered
could close mind It heart
saved Harry closed eyes If
gone save Sirius Sirius would died
More stave moment would
think Sirius Harry asked without caring much
answer The end prophecy something
neither live
survives said Dumbledore
So said Harry dredging words felt like
deep well despair inside mean
one us got kill
one end Yes
said Dumbledore For long time neither
spoke Somewhere far beyond office walls Harry could hear sound
voices students heading Great Hall early
breakfast perhaps It seemed impossible could people
world still desired food laughed neither knew cared
Sirius Black gone ever Sirius seemed million miles
away already even part Harry still believed
pulled back veil would found Sirius
looking back greeting perhaps laugh like
bark I feel I owe
another explanation Harry said Dumbledore hesitantly You may perhaps wondered
I never chose prefect I must confess
I rather thought enough responsibility
going Harry looked
saw tear trickling Dumbledores face long silver beard

Voldemort planted mind would given almost anything
wizarding world know telling truth
believe Voldemort back know
neither liar mad Now however
He walked short way around lake sat
bank sheltered gaze passersby behind
tangle shrubs stared gleaming water thinking
Perhaps reason wanted
alone felt isolated everybody since talk
Dumbledore An invisible barrier separated rest
world He always marked man
It never really understood meant
And yet sitting
edge lake terrible weight grief dragging
loss Sirius raw fresh inside
could muster great sense fear It sunny
grounds around full laughing people even though
felt distant though belonged
different race still hard believe sat
life must include end murder
He sat long time gazing
water trying think godfather
remember directly across opposite bank
Sirius collapsed trying fend hundred Dementors
The sun set
realised cold He got returned castle
wiping face sleeve wentRon Hermione left
hospital wing completely cured three days end term
Hermione kept showing signs wanting talk Sirius Ron
tended make hushing noises every time mentioned name Harry
still sure whether wanted talk
godfather yet wishes varied mood He knew one
thing though unhappy felt moment would greatly
miss Hogwarts days time back

return every summer feel better
Indeed never dreaded return
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts day end term
It seemed crept hospital wing dinnertime
evidently hoping depart undetected unfortunately met Peeves
way seized last chance Fred
instructed chased gleefully premises whacking alternately
walking stick sock full chalk Many students
ran Entrance Hall watch running away
path Heads Houses tried halfheartedly restrain
Indeed Professor McGonagall sank back chair staff
table feeble remonstrances clearly heard express
regret could run cheering Umbridge
Peeves borrowed walking stick Their last evening
school arrived people finished packing already heading
endofterm leaving feast Harry even started
Just tomorrow said Ron waiting

I wont long look go ahead
But dormitory door closed
behind Ron Harry made effort speed packing The

Disappointment burning throat got began throwing

He ran staircases along

hedgerows beneath summer sky bright blue forgetmenot
Some ten feet front stood short plump man
wearing enormously thick glasses reduced eyes molelike specks He

passed wooden sign Harry looked two arms
The one pointing back way come read Great Hangleton
5 miles The arm pointing Ogden said Little Hangleton 1 mile
They walked short way nothing see hedgerows
wide blue sky overhead swishing frockcoated figure ahead Then
lane curved left fell away sloping steeply
hillside sudden unexpected view
whole valley laid front Harry could see
village undoubtedly Little Hangleton nestled two steep hills church
graveyard clearly visible Across valley set opposite hillside
handsome manor house surrounded wide expanse velvety green
lawn Ogden broken reluctant trot due steep
downward slope Dumbledore lengthened stride Harry hurried keep
He thought Little Hangleton must final destination wondered

mistaken thinking going village
however The lane curved right rounded

sloping downhill like last one seemed heading
patch dark trees little Sure enough

cool shadows seconds Harrys eyes discerned
building halfhidden amongst tangle trunks It seemed
strange location choose house else
odd decision leave trees growing nearby blocking light
view valley He wondered whether inhabited
walls mossy many tiles fallen
roof rafters visible places Nettles grew around
tips reaching windows tiny thick
grime Just concluded nobody could possibly live
however one windows thrown open clatter
thin trickle steam smoke issued though
somebody cooking Ogden moved forward quietly seemed Harry
rather cautiously As dark shadows trees slid
stopped staring front door somebody
nailed dead snake Then rustle crack
man rags dropped nearest tree landing
feet right front Ogden leapt backward fast
stood tails frock coat stumbled Youre
welcome The man standing thick hair matted
dirt could color Several teeth
missing His eyes small dark stared opposite directions
He might looked comical effect
frightening Harry could blame Ogden backing away several
paces spoke Er — good morning Im Ministry
Magic — Youre welcome Er — Im sorry — I

dim stranger making clear Harrys opinion particularly
brandishing wand one hand short

jingling clopping sounds growing faint Darling whispered Morfin
Parseltongue looking sister Darling called So

going faint Whats said Gaunt sharply also Parseltongue
looking son daughter What say Morfin
She likes looking Muggle said Morfin vicious expression
face stared sister looked terrified
Always garden passes peering hedge
isnt And last night — Merope shook head
jerkily imploringly Morfin went ruthlessly Hanging window
waiting ride home wasnt Hanging
window look Muggle said Gaunt quietly All three
Gaunts seemed forgotten Ogden looking bewildered
irritated renewed outbreak incomprehensible hissing rasping Is
true said Gaunt deadly voice advancing step
two toward terrified girl My daughter—pureblooded descendant Salazar Slytherin —
hankering filthy dirtveined Muggle Merope shook head frantically pressing
wall apparently unable speak But I got
Father cackled Morfin I got went
didnt look pretty hives Merope
You disgusting little Squib filthy little blood traitor roared Gaunt losing
control hands closed around daughters throat Both Harry
Ogden yelled No time Ogden raised wand
cried Relaskio Gaunt thrown backward away daughter tripped
chair fell flat back With roar
rage Morfin leapt chair ran Ogden
brandishing bloody knife firing hexes indiscriminately wand Ogden
ran life Dumbledore indicated ought follow
Harry obeyed Meropes screams echoing ears Ogden hurtled
path erupted onto main lane arms head
collided glossy chestnut horse ridden
handsome darkhaired young man Both pretty girl riding beside
gray horse roared laughter sight
Ogden bounced horses flank set
frock coat flying covered head foot dust running pellmell
lane I think Harry said Dumbledore He
took Harry elbow tugged Next moment
soaring weightlessly darkness landed squarely feet back
Dumbledores twilit office What happened girl
cottage said Harry Dumbledore lit extra lamps
flick wand Merope whatever name Oh
survived said Dumbledore reseating behind desk indicating Harry
sit Ogden Apparated back Ministry returned
reinforcements within fifteen minutes Morfin father attempted fight
overpowered removed cottage subsequently convicted
Wizengamot Morfin already record Muggle attacks
sentenced three years Azkaban Marvolo injured several Ministry
employees addition Ogden received six months Marvolo Harry repeated wonderingly Thats
right said Dumbledore smiling approval I glad see youre
keeping That old man — Voldemorts grandfather yes said
Dumbledore Marvolo son Morfin daughter Merope last
Gaunts ancient Wizarding family noted vein
instability violence flourished generations due
habit marrying cousins Lack sense coupled
great liking grandeur meant family gold squandered several
generations Marvolo born He saw left
squalor poverty nasty temper fantastic amount
arrogance pride couple family heirlooms treasured
much son rather daughter
So Merope said Harry leaning forward chair staring
Dumbledore Merope Sir mean
Voldemorts mother It said Dumbledore And
happens also glimpse Voldemorts father I
wonder whether noticed The Muggle Morfin attacked The man
horse Very good indeed said Dumbledore beaming Yes Tom Riddle
senior handsome Muggle used go riding past Gaunt
cottage Merope Gaunt cherished secret burning passion And
ended married Harry said disbelief unable imagine two
people less likely fall love I think
forgetting said Dumbledore Merope witch I
believe magical powers appeared best advantage
terrorized father Once Marvolo Morfin safely
Azkaban alone free first time
life I sure able give
full rein abilities plot escape
desperate life led eighteen years Can think
measure Merope could taken make Tom Riddle forget
Muggle companion fall love instead The Imperius
Curse Harry suggested Or love potion Very good Personally I
inclined think used love potion I sure
would seemed romantic I
think would difficult hot day Riddle
riding alone persuade take drink water
In case within months scene
witnessed village Little Hangleton enjoyed tremendous scandal You
imagine gossip caused squires son ran
tramps daughter Merope But villagers shock nothing
Marvolos He returned Azkaban expecting find daughter dutifully awaiting
return hot meal ready table Instead
found clear inch dust note farewell explaining
done From I able
discover never mentioned name existence time forth
The shock desertion may contributed early death
— perhaps simply never learned feed Azkaban
greatly weakened Marvolo live see Morfin
return cottage And Merope She died didnt
Wasnt Voldemort brought orphanage Yes indeed said Dumbledore
We must certain amount guessing although I
think difficult deduce happened You see within
months runaway marriage Tom Riddle reappeared
manor house Little Hangleton without wife The rumor flew around
neighborhood talking hoodwinked taken
What meant I sure
enchantment lifted though I daresay
dare use precise words fear thought insane When
heard saying however villagers guessed Merope
lied Tom Riddle pretending going
baby married reason But
baby But year
married Tom Riddle left still pregnant What
went wrong asked Harry Why love potion stop working Again
guesswork said Dumbledore I believe Merope
deeply love husband could bear continue enslaving
magical means I believe made choice
stop giving potion Perhaps besotted
convinced would fallen love
return Perhaps thought would stay babys
sake If wrong counts He left
never saw never troubled discover became
son The sky outside inky black lamps
Dumbledores office seemed glow brightly I think
tonight Harry said Dumbledore moment two
Yes sir said Harry He got feet
leave Sir important know Voldemorts
past Very important I think said Dumbledore And got something
prophecy It everything
prophecy Right said Harry little confused reassured
He turned go another question occurred
turned back Sir I allowed tell Ron Hermione
everything youve told Dumbledore considered moment said
Yes I think Mr Weasley Miss Granger proved trustworthy
But Harry I going ask ask
repeat anybody else It would
good idea word got around much I know
suspect Lord Voldemorts secrets No sir Ill make sure
Ron Hermione Good night He turned away almost
door saw Sitting one
little spindlelegged tables supported many fraillooking silver instruments
ugly gold ring set large cracked black stone Sir said

given increasingly tight security measures around school pleased
know going ahead always good
get castle grounds hours Harry woke
early morning trip proving stormy
whiled away time breakfast reading copy Advanced
PotionMaking He usually lie bed reading textbooks
sort behavior Ron rightly said indecent anybody except
Hermione simply weird way Harry felt however
HalfBlood Princes copy Advanced PotionMaking hardly qualified textbook The
Harry pored book realized much
handy hints shortcuts potions
earning glowing reputation Slughorn also
imaginative little jinxes hexes scribbled margins Harry
sure judging crossingsout revisions Prince
invented Harry already attempted Princes selfinvented
spells There hex caused toenails grow alarmingly
fast tried Crabbe corridor
entertaining results jinx glued tongue roof
mouth twice used general applause
unsuspecting Argus Filch perhaps useful Muffliato spell
filled ears anyone nearby unidentifiable buzzing
lengthy conversations could held class overheard
The person find charms amusing Hermione
maintained rigidly disapproving expression throughout refused talk
Harry used Muffliato spell anyone
vicinity Sitting bed Harry turned book sideways
examine closely scribbled instructions spell seemed
caused Prince trouble There many crossingsout
alterations finally crammed corner page scribble
Levicorpus nvbl While wind sleet pounded relentlessly

brackets Nvbl mean nonverbal Harry rather doubted
would able bring particular spell
still difficulty nonverbal spells something Snape quick
comment every DADA class On hand Prince

heap onto mattress Sorry repeated Harry weakly Dean Seamus
continued roar laughter Tomorrow said Ron muffled voice
Id rather set alarm clock By time
got dressed padding several Mrs Weasleys handknitted sweaters
carrying cloaks scarves gloves Rons shock subsided
decided Harrys new spell highly amusing amusing
fact lost time regaling Hermione story
sat breakfast another
flash light I landed bed Ron grinned
helping sausages Hermione cracked smile
anecdote turned expression wintry disapproval upon Harry Was
spell chance another one potion book
asked Harry frowned Always jump worst
conclusion dont Was Well yeah

incantation see would happen Why matter

looking furious Potter I appreciate telling cannot
point finger blame Mr Malfoy purely visited
shop necklace might purchased The
probably true hundreds people — — thats I said

believe Hagrid first told Yes Riddle perfectly
ready believe use word special said

met dangerous Dark wizard time said
Dumbledore No I idea grow
However I certainly intrigued
I returned Hogwarts intending keep eye upon something
I done case given alone
friendless already I felt I ought
others sake much His powers heard
surprisingly welldeveloped young wizard interestingly ominously
already discovered measure
control begun use consciously And
saw random experiments typical young wizards He
already using magic people frighten punish
control The little stories strangled rabbit young boy
girl lured cave suggestive
I make hurt I want
And Parselmouth interjected Harry Yes indeed rare
ability one supposedly connected Dark Arts although
know Parselmouths among great good In
fact ability speak serpents make nearly
uneasy obvious instincts cruelty secrecy domination Time
making fools us said Dumbledore indicating dark sky
beyond windows But part I want draw
attention certain features scene witnessed
great bearing matters shall discussing
future meetings Firstly I hope noticed Riddles reaction I
mentioned another shared first name Tom Harry nodded There
showed contempt anything tied people anything
made ordinary Even wished different separate
notorious He shed name know within short
years conversation created mask Lord Voldemort behind
hidden long I trust
also noticed Tom Riddle already highly selfsufficient secretive apparently
friendless He want help companionship trip
Diagon Alley He preferred operate alone The adult Voldemort
You hear many Death Eaters claiming
confidence alone close even
understand They deluded Lord Voldemort never friend
I believe ever wanted one And lastly
I hope sleepy pay attention
Harry young Tom Riddle liked collect trophies You saw
box stolen articles hidden room These
taken victims bullying behavior souvenirs

Hermiones hair Ron beat back pair
secateurs Harry succeeded trapping couple vines knotting
together hole opened middle tentaclelike branches
Hermione plunged arm bravely hole closed like

sheepish also rather pleased Hand Harry said
Hermione hurriedly It says supposed puncture something sharp
Harry passed pod bowl
Ron snapped goggles back eyes dived

really surprised thought Harry wrestled thorny vine intent
upon throttling inkling might happen
sooner later But sure felt
He Cho embarrassed look

Hermione started going together split Could friendship survive
Harry remembered weeks talking
third year enjoyed trying
bridge distance And didnt
split What became like Bill Fleur
became excruciatingly embarrassing presence

Hat touched head continued Dumbledore waving blackened hand toward
shelf head Sorting Hat sat ancient unmoving
How soon Riddle learned famous founder House could
talk snakes I know — perhaps evening
The knowledge excited increased sense
selfimportance However frightening impressing fellow Slytherins displays
Parseltongue common room hint reached
staff He showed sign outward arrogance aggression
As unusually talented goodlooking orphan naturally drew attention
sympathy staff almost moment arrival
He seemed police quiet thirsty knowledge Nearly
favorably impressed Didnt tell sir hed
like met orphanage asked Harry No I
Though shown hint remorse
possible felt sorry behaved
resolved turn fresh leaf I chose give
chance Dumbledore paused looked inquiringly Harry
opened mouth speak Here Dumbledores tendency trust
people spite overwhelming evidence deserve
But Harry remembered something But didnt really
trust sir He told
Riddle came diary said Dumbledore never seemed
like much teachers Let us say
I take granted trustworthy
said Dumbledore I I already indicated resolved keep
close eye upon I I cannot pretend
I gleaned great deal observations first He
guarded felt I sure
thrill discovering true identity told little
much He careful never reveal much
could take back let slip
excitement Mrs Cole confided However
sense never try charm charmed
many colleagues As moved school gathered
group dedicated friends I call
want better term although I already indicated Riddle
undoubtedly felt affection This group
kind dark glamour within castle They motley collection
mixture weak seeking protection ambitious seeking shared
glory thuggish gravitating toward leader could show
refined forms cruelty In words forerunners
Death Eaters indeed became first
Death Eaters leaving Hogwarts Rigidly controlled Riddle never
detected open wrongdoing although seven years Hogwarts marked
number nasty incidents never satisfactorily
linked serious course opening
Chamber Secrets resulted death girl
As know Hagrid wrongly accused crime I
able find many memories Riddle Hogwarts said

searching old records questioning Muggle wizard witnesses alike Those
I could persuade talk told Riddle obsessed

memory felt familiar sensation falling nothingness
landed upon dirty stone floor almost total darkness It
took several seconds recognize place time Dumbledore
landed beside The Gaunts house indescribably filthy
anywhere Harry ever seen The ceiling thick cobwebs
floor coated grime moldy rotting food lay upon
table amidst mass crusted pots The light came
single guttering candle placed feet man
hair beard overgrown Harry could see neither eyes mouth
He slumped armchair fire Harry wondered
moment whether dead But came
loud knock door man jerked awake raising
wand right hand short knife left
The door creaked open There threshold holding oldfashioned lamp

bottles feet clattering tinkling across floor YOU
bellowed YOU And hurtled drunkenly Riddle wand knife held
aloft Stop Riddle spoke Parseltongue The man skidded table
sending moldy pots crashing floor He stared Riddle There
long silence contemplated The man broke
You speak Yes I speak said Riddle He moved
forward room allowing door swing shut behind
Harry could help feel resentful admiration Voldemorts complete
lack fear His race merely expressed disgust perhaps disappointment Where
Marvolo asked Dead said Died years ago didnt
Riddle frowned Who thenI’m Morfin aint IMarvolos son Course
I Morfin pushed hair
dirty face better see Riddle Harry saw
wore Marvolos blackstoned ring right hand I thought
Muggle whispered Morfin You look mighty like Muggle What
Muggle said Riddle sharply That Muggle sister took fancy
Muggle lives big house way

need question use Veritaserum Legilimency He admitted
murder spot giving details murderer could know
He proud said killed Muggles
awaiting chance years He handed wand
proved used kill Riddles
And permitted led Azkaban without
fight All disturbed fact fathers ring
disappeared Hell kill losing told captors
Hell kill losing ring And
apparently ever said He lived
remainder life Azkaban lamenting loss Marvolos last
heirloom buried beside prison alongside poor souls
expired within walls So Voldemort stole Morfins wand
used said Harry sitting straight Thats right said Dumbledore We
memories show us I think
fairly sure happened Voldemort Stupefied uncle took wand
proceeded across valley big house way There
murdered Muggle man abandoned witch mother
good measure Muggle grandparents thus obliterating last
unworthy Riddle line revenging upon father never wanted
Then returned Gaunt hovel performed complex bit
magic would implant false memory uncles mind
laid Morfins wand beside unconscious owner pocketed ancient ring
wore departed And Morfin never realized hadnt done Never
said Dumbledore He gave I say full boastful confession
But real memory time Yes
took great deal skilled Legilimency coax
said Dumbledore anybody delve
Morfins mind already confessed crime However I
able secure visit Morfin last weeks
life time I attempting discover
much I could Voldemorts past I extracted memory
difficulty When I saw contained I attempted use
secure Morfins release Azkaban Before Ministry reached decision
however Morfin died But come Ministry didnt realize
Voldemort done Morfin Harry asked angrily He
underage time wasnt I thought could detect underage
magic You quite right — detect magic
perpetrator You remember blamed Ministry
Hover Charm fact cast — Dobby
growled Harry injustice still rankled So youre underage
magic inside adult witch wizards house Ministry wont
know They certainly unable tell performed magic
said Dumbledore smiling slightly look great indignation Harrys
face They rely witch wizard parents enforce offsprings
obedience within walls Well thats rubbish snapped Harry Look
happened look happened Morfin I agree said Dumbledore Whatever
Morfin deserve die blamed
murders committed But getting late
I want see memory part
Dumbledore took inside pocket another crystal phial Harry fell

boys tittered something odd happened The whole room suddenly
filled thick white fog Harry could see nothing
face Dumbledore standing beside Then Slughorns
voice rang mist unnaturally loudly Youll go wrong boy
mark words The fog cleared suddenly

look though anything unusual happened Bewildered Harry looked around
small golden clock standing upon Slughorns desk chimed eleven oclock
Good gracious time already said Slughorn Youd better get

important memory could see
significant Admittedly fog fact

Veritaserum Professor Slughorn extremely able wizard
expecting said Dumbledore He much accomplished
Occlumency poor Morfin Gaunt I would astonished

This infuriating already cutting fine get
match time yet Malfoy skulking
rest school absent Harrys best chance yet
discovering Malfoy The silent seconds trickled past
Harry remained frozen gazing place Malfoy

sprinted changing rooms The whole team changed ready
Coote Peakes Beaters hitting clubs nervously

scarlet robes headSo I wanted know come hes

Snitch If could catch good early
might chance could get back castle
seize Marauders Map find Malfoy
And thats Smith Hufflepuff Quaffle said dreamy
voice echoing grounds He commentary last time
course Ginny Weasley flew I think probably purpose
looked like Smith quite rude Gryffindor I
expect regrets hes playing — oh look hes
lost Quaffle Ginny took I like
shes nice Harry stared commentators podium Surely nobody
right mind would let Luna Lovegood commentate But even
mistaking long dirtyblonde hair
necklace butterbeer corks Beside Luna Professor McGonagall
looking slightly uncomfortable though indeed second thoughts
appointment big Hufflepuff players got
Quaffle I cant remember name something like
Bibble — Buggins —Its Cadwallader said Professor McGonagall loudly beside
Luna The crowd laughedHarry stared around Snitch
sign Moments later Cadwallader scored McLaggen shouting criticism
Ginny allowing Quaffle possession
result noticed large red ball soaring past
right earMcLaggen pay attention youre supposed
leave everyone else alone bellowed Harry wheeling around
face KeeperYoure setting great example McLaggen shouted back redfaced
furiousAnd Harry Potters argument Keeper said
Luna serenely Hufflepuffs Slytherins crowd cheered
jeered I dont think thatll help find Snitch
maybe clever ruse Swearing angrily Harry spun round set
around pitch scanning skies sign
tiny winged golden ballGinny Demelza scored goal apiece giving
redandgoldclad supporters something cheer Then Cadwallader scored
making things level Luna seem noticed
appeared singularly uninterested mundane things score kept
attempting draw crowds attention things interestingly shaped
clouds possibility Zacharias Smith far failed
maintain possession Quaffle longer minute
suffering something called Losers LurgySeventyforty Hufflepuff barked Professor McGonagall
Lunas megaphoneIs already said Luna vaguely Oh look The Gryffindor Keepers
got hold one Beaters batsHarry spun around midair
Sure enough McLaggen reasons best known pulled Peakess
bat appeared demonstrating hit
Bludger toward oncoming CadwalladerWill give back bat
get back goal posts roared Harry pelting toward McLaggen
McLaggen took ferocious swipe Bludger mishit itA
blinding sickening pain flash light distant screams
sensation falling long tunnel
And next thing Harry knew lying

raised head awkwardly There left familiarlooking freckly
redhaired personNice drop said Ron grinningHarry blinked

He stopped talking suddenly Lavender Brown standing foot
marble staircase looking thunderous Hi said Ron nervously
Cmon Harry muttered Hermione sped past though
heard Lavender say Why didnt tell
getting today And Ron
looked sulky annoyed appeared breakfast half
hour later though sat Lavender Harry see
exchange word time together Hermione
acting though quite oblivious
twice Harry saw inexplicable smirk cross face All
day seemed particularly good mood
evening common room even consented look
words finish writing Harrys Herbology essay something
resolutely refusing point known
Harry would let Ron copy work Thanks
lot Hermione said Harry giving hasty pat
back checked watch saw nearly
eight oclock Listen I’ve got hurry Ill late
Dumbledore She answer merely crossed
feebler sentences weary sort way
Grinning Harry hurried portrait hole
headmasters office The gargoyle leapt aside mention toffee eclairs
Harry took spiral staircase two steps time knocking
door clock within chimed eight
Enter called Dumbledore Harry put hand push
door wrenched open inside There stood Professor Trelawney
Aha cried pointing dramatically Harry blinked
magnifying spectacles So
reason I thrown unceremoniously office Dumbledore
My dear Sybill said Dumbledore slightly exasperated voice
question throwing unceremoniously anywhere Harry
appointment I really dont think
said — Very well said Professor Trelawney
deeply wounded voice If banish usurping nag
Perhaps I shall find school
talents better appreciated She pushed past
Harry disappeared spiral staircase heard stumble halfway
Harry guessed tripped one
trailing shawls Please close door sit Harry
said Dumbledore sounding rather tired Harry obeyed noticing
took usual seat front Dumbledores desk Pensieve
lay two tiny crystal bottles
full swirling memory Professor Trelawney still isnt happy Firenze
teaching Harry asked No said Dumbledore Divination
turning much trouble I could foreseen
never studied subject I cannot ask Firenze return
forest outcast I
ask Sybill Trelawney leave Between idea
danger would outside castle She
know — I think would unwise enlighten
— made prophecy Voldemort see
Dumbledore heaved deep sigh said But never mind
staffing problems We much important matters discuss Firstly
— managed task I set end
previous lesson Ah said Harry brought short
What Apparition lessons Quidditch Ron poisoned getting
skull cracked determination find Draco Malfoy
Harry almost forgotten memory Dumbledore
asked extract Professor Slughorn Well I asked Professor Slughorn
end Potions sir er wouldnt
give There little silence I
see said Dumbledore eventually peering Harry top
halfmoon spectacles giving Harry usual sensation
Xrayed And feel exerted best efforts
matter That exercised
considerable ingenuity That left depth cunning unplumbed
quest retrieve memory Well Harry stalled
loss say next His single attempt get
hold memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble Well
day Ron swallowed love potion mistake I took
Professor Slughorn I thought maybe I got Professor Slughorn
good enough mood — And work asked Dumbledore Well
sir Ron got poisoned — — naturally made forget
trying retrieve memory I would expected nothing
else best friend danger Once became clear
Mr Weasley going make full recovery however I
would hoped returned task I set
I thought I made clear important
memory Indeed I best impress upon
crucial memory
wasting time without A hot prickly feeling
shame spread top Harry’s head way
body Dumbledore raised voice
even sound angry Harry would preferred yell
cold disappointment worse anything Sir said
little desperately isnt I wasnt bothered anything Ive
— things Other things
mind Dumbledore finished sentence I see
Silence fell uncomfortable silence Harry
ever experienced Dumbledore seemed go punctuated
little grunting snores portrait Armando Dippet
Dumbledores head Harry felt strangely diminished though shrunk
little since entered room When could stand
longer said Professor Dumbledore Im really sorry I
done I realized wouldnt asked
wasnt really important Thank
saying Harry said Dumbledore quietly May I hope
give matter higher priority There
little point meeting tonight unless
memory Ill sir Ill get
said earnestly Then shall say
said Dumbledore kindly continue story
left You remember Yes
sir said Harry quickly Voldemort killed father grandparents
made look though Uncle Morfin Then
went back Hogwarts asked asked Professor Slughorn
Horcruxes mumbled shamefacedly Very good said Dumbledore Now
remember I hope I told
outset meetings would entering
realms guesswork speculation “Yes sir” Thus
far I hope agree I shown reasonably firm
sources fact deductions Voldemort
age seventeen Harry nodded But
Harry said Dumbledore things become murkier stranger If
difficult find evidence boy Riddle almost
impossible find anyone prepared reminisce man Voldemort In
fact I doubt whether soul alive apart
could give us full account life since
left Hogwarts However I two last memories I would like
share Dumbledore indicated two little crystal bottles gleaming
beside Pensieve I shall glad opinion
whether conclusions I drawn seem likely
The idea Dumbledore valued opinion highly made Harry
feel even deeply ashamed failed task
retrieving Horcrux memory shifted guiltily seat
Dumbledore raised first two bottles light
examined I hope tired
diving peoples memories curious recollections two
said This first one came old houseelf
name Hokey Before see Hokey witnessed I must
quickly recount Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts He reached
seventh year schooling might expected top
grades every examination taken All around classmates
deciding jobs pursue left
Hogwarts Nearly everybody expected spectacular things Tom Riddle prefect Head Boy
winner Award Special Services School I know
several teachers Professor Slughorn amongst suggested join
Ministry Magic offered set appointments put touch
useful contacts He refused offers The next thing staff
knew Voldemort working Borgin Burkes At Borgin
Burkes Harry repeated stunned At Borgin Burkes repeated
Dumbledore calmly I think see attractions place held
entered Hokeys memory But
Voldemorts first choice job Hardly anyone knew
time — I one
headmaster confided — Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet asked whether
could remain Hogwarts teacher He wanted
stay Why asked Harry amazed still I
believe several reasons though confided none
Professor Dippet said Dumbledore Firstly importantly Voldemort I believe
attached school ever
person Hogwarts happiest first
place felt home Harry felt slightly uncomfortable
words exactly felt Hogwarts
Secondly castle stronghold ancient magic
Undoubtedly Voldemort penetrated many secrets
students pass place may felt
still mysteries unravel stores magic tap
And thirdly teacher would great
power influence young witches wizards Perhaps gained
idea Professor Slughorn teacher
best terms demonstrated influential role teacher
play I imagine instant Voldemort envisaged spending
rest life Hogwarts I think
saw useful recruiting ground place
might begin build army But
didnt get job sir No Professor
Dippet told young eighteen invited
reapply years still wished
teach How feel sir asked Harry
hesitantly Deeply uneasy said Dumbledore I advised Armando appointment
— I give reasons I given
Professor Dippet fond Voldemort convinced honesty
But I want Lord Voldemort back school
especially position power Which job
want sir What subject want teach
Somehow Harry knew answer even Dumbledore gave
Defense Against Dark Arts It taught time
old Professor name Galatea Merrythought
Hogwarts nearly fifty years So Voldemort went
Borgin Burkes staff admired
said waste brilliant young wizard like
working shop However Voldemort mere assistant Polite
handsome clever soon given particular jobs
type exist place like Borgin Burkes

— trick light I suppose — said Hepzibah
looking unnerved Harry guessed seen momentary
red gleam Voldemorts eyes Here Hokey take away lock
The usual enchantments Time leave
Harry said Dumbledore quietly tie elf bobbed away
bearing boxes Dumbledore grasped Harry elbow
together rose oblivion back Dumbledores office
Hepzibah Smith died two days little scene said Dumbledore
resuming seat indicating Harry Hokey
houseelf convicted Ministry poisoning mistresss evening
cocoa accident No way said Harry angrily
I see one mind said Dumbledore Certainly
many similarities death Riddles In
cases somebody else took blame someone clear memory
caused death — Hokey confessed She remembered
putting something mistresss cocoa turned
sugar lethal littleknown poison said Dumbledore It concluded
meant old
confused — Voldemort modified memory like
Morfin Yes conclusion said Dumbledore And
Morfin Ministry predisposed suspect Hokey —
— houseelf said Harry He rarely
felt sympathy society Hermione set SPEW
Precisely said Dumbledore She old admitted tampered
drink nobody Ministry bothered inquire As
case Morfin time I traced
managed extract memory life almost —
memory course proves nothing except Voldemort knew
existence cup locket By time
Hokey convicted Hepzibahs family realized two greatest
treasures missing It took sure
many hiding places always guarded collection
jealously But sure beyond doubt cup
locket gone assistant worked
Borgin Burkes young man visited Hepzibah regularly
charmed well resigned post vanished His
superiors idea gone surprised
anyone disappearance And last
seen heard Tom Riddle long time
Now said Dumbledore dont mind Harry I want
pause draw attention certain points
story Voldemort committed another murder whether first since
killed Riddles I know I think
This time seen killed
revenge gain He wanted two fabulous trophies poor
besotted old woman showed Just robbed
children orphanage stolen Uncle
Morfin’s ring ran Hepzibahs cup locket
But said Harry frowning seems mad
Risking everything throwing away job
Mad perhaps Voldemort said Dumbledore
I hope understand due course exactly objects
meant Harry must admit
difficult imagine saw locket least rightfully
The locket maybe said Harry take cup
well It belonged another Hogwarts’s founders said
Dumbledore I think still felt great pull toward school
could resist object steeped Hogwarts
history There reasons I think I hope
able demonstrate due course And
last recollection I show
least manage retrieve Professor Slughorns memory us Ten
years separates Hokey’s memory one ten years
guess Lord Voldemort
Harry got feet Dumbledore emptied last
memory Pensieve Whose memory asked
Mine said Dumbledore And Harry dived Dumbledore
shifting silver mass landing office left
There Fawkes slumbering happily perch behind
desk Dumbledore looked similar Dumbledore standing beside Harry
though hands whole undamaged face perhaps
little less lined The one difference presentday office
one snowing past bluish flecks
drifting past window dark building
outside ledge The younger Dumbledore seemed waiting
something sure enough moments arrival
knock door said Enter Harry let
hastily stifled gasp Voldemort entered room His features
Harry seen emerge great stone cauldron
almost two years ago They snakelike eyes
yet scarlet face yet masklike yet
longer handsome Tom Riddle It though features
burned blurred waxy oddly distorted
whites eyes permanently bloody look though
pupils yet slits Harry knew would become
He wearing long black cloak face
pale snow glistening shoulders The Dumbledore
behind desk showed sign surprise Evidently visit
made appointment Good evening Tom said Dumbledore easily
Wont sit Thank said Voldemort
took seat Dumbledore gestured — seat
looks Harry vacated
present I heard become headmaster said
voice slightly higher colder A worthy
choice I glad approve said Dumbledore smiling May
I offer drink That would welcome said
Voldemort I come long way Dumbledore stood
swept cabinet kept Pensieve
full bottles Having handed Voldemort goblet
wine poured one returned seat behind
desk So Tom I owe
pleasure Voldemort answer merely sipped
wine They call Tom anymore
said These days 1 known — I know
known said Dumbledore smiling pleasantly But
Im afraid always Tom Riddle It one
irritating things old teachers I afraid never
quite forget charges youthful beginnings He raised glass
though toasting Voldemort whose face remained expressionless Nevertheless Harry felt
atmosphere room change subtly Dumbledores refusal use Voldemort’s chosen
name refusal allow Voldemort dictate terms
meeting Harry could tell Voldemort took
I surprised remained long said
Voldemort short pause I always wondered wizard
never wished leave school Well said Dumbledore
still smiling wizard nothing
important passing ancient skills helping hone young minds If
I remember correctly saw attraction teaching
I see still said Voldemort I merely wondered
— often asked advice Ministry
twice I think offered post Minister —
Three times last count actually said Dumbledore But
Ministry never attracted career Again something
common I think Voldemort inclined head unsmiling
took another sip wine Dumbledore break silence
stretched waited look pleasant expectancy
Voldemort talk first I returned said
little later perhaps Professor Dippet expected
I returned nevertheless request
told I young I come
ask permit return castle
teach I think must know I seen
done much since I left place I could show tell
students things gain wizard
Dumbledore considered Voldemort top goblet
speaking Yes I certainly know
seen done much since leaving us said quietly Rumors
doings reached old school Tom I
sorry believe half Voldemorts expression remained impassive
said Greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawns lies
You must know Dumbledore You call greatness
asked Dumbledore delicately Certainly
said Voldemort eyes seemed burn red I experimented
I pushed boundaries magic perhaps
ever pushed — Of kinds magic Dumbledore
corrected quietly Of Of others remain
forgive woefully ignorant For first
time Voldemort smiled It taut leer evil thing
threatening look rage The old argument
said softly But nothing I seen world supported
famous pronouncements love powerful kind
magic Dumbledore Perhaps looking wrong
places suggested Dumbledore Well better place start
fresh researches Hogwarts said Voldemort Will let
return Will let share knowledge students
I place talents disposal I
command Dumbledore raised eyebrows And become
command What happen call
— rumor — Death Eaters
Harry could tell Voldemort expected Dumbledore know
name saw Voldemort’s eyes flash red slitlike
nostrils flare My friends said moments pause
carry without I sure I
glad hear consider friends said Dumbledore I
impression order servants
You mistaken said Voldemort Then I
go Hogs Head tonight I would find
group — Nott Rosier Muldber Dolohov — awaiting
return Devoted friends indeed travel far
snowy night merely wish luck attempted secure
teaching post There could doubt Dumbledores
detailed knowledge traveling even less
welcome Voldemort however rallied almost You
omniscient ever Dumbledore Oh merely friendly
local barmen said Dumbledore lightly Now Tom
Dumbledore set empty glass drew
seat tips fingers together characteristic
gesture Let us speak openly Why come
tonight surrounded henchmen request job know
want Voldemort looked coldly surprised A job I
want On contrary Dumbledore I want much
Oh want come back Hogwarts

eighteen What youre Tom Why try open
request Voldemort sneered If want

said Dumbledore And I dont think moment expected
Nevertheless came asked must
purpose Voldemort stood He looked less like Tom Riddle
ever features thick rage This final word
It said Dumbledore also standing Then
nothing say No nothing
said Dumbledore great sadness filled face The time
long gone I could frighten burning wardrobe
force make repayment crimes But I wish I
could Tom I wish I could
For second Harry verge shouting pointless
warning He sure Voldemorts hand twitched toward pocket
wand moment passed Voldemort turned
away door closing gone Harry
felt Dumbledores hand close arm moments later
standing together almost spot
snow building window ledge Dumbledores hand blackened
deadlooking Why said Harry looking
Dumbledores face Why come back Did ever find

temple withdrew long silver thread
memory came away clinging wand tip Longer longer
memory stretched broke swung silvery bright

hour ago Nearly Headless Nick gliding toward Harry head
wobbling usual upon ruff I Bloody

Where said Harry heart leaping” Oh groaning
clanking Astronomy Tower favorite pastime
— Not Bloody Baron — Dumbledore
Oh — office said Nick I believe
Baron said business attend turning

chest prospect telling Dumbledore secured memory
He wheeled sprinted ignoring Fat Lady
calling Come back All right I lied
I annoyed woke The passwords still tapeworm
But Harry already hurtling back along corridor within
minutes saying toffee eclairs Dumbledores gargoyle leapt aside
permitting Harry entrance onto spiral staircase Enter said Dumbledore
Harry knocked He sounded exhausted Harry pushed open door There
Dumbledores office looking ever black starstrewn
skies beyond windows Good gracious Harry said Dumbledore surprise To
I owe late pleasure Sir —
Ive got I’ve got memory Slughorn Harry
pulled tiny glass bottle showed Dumbledore For
moment two headmaster looked stunned Then face split
wide smile Harry spectacular news Very
well done indeed I knew could All
thought lateness hour apparently forgotten hurried around
desk took bottle Slughorns memory uninjured hand
strode cabinet kepi Pensieve And
said Dumbledore placing stone basin upon desk emptying
contents bottle Now last shall
see Harry quickly Harry bowed obediently
Pensieve felt feet leave office floor
Once fell darkness landed Horace Slughorns
office many years There much younger Slughorn
thick shiny strawcolored hair gingeryblond mustache sitting
comfortable winged armchair office feet resting upon velvet
pouffe small glass wine one hand rummaging
box crystallized pineapple And half dozen
teenage boys sitting around Slughorn Tom Riddle midst
Marvolos goldandblack ring gleaming finger Dumbledore landed
beside Harry Riddle asked Sir true Professor
Merrythought retiring Tom Tom I knew I couldnt
tell said Slughorn wagging finger reprovingly Riddle though winking
time I must say Id like know
get information boy knowledgeable half staff
Riddle smiled boys laughed cast
admiring looks What uncanny ability know things
shouldnt careful flattery people matter —
thank pineapple way youre quite right
favorite — Several boys tittered — I
confidently expect rise Minister Magic within twenty years
Fifteen keep sending pineapple I excellent contacts
Ministry Tom Riddle merely smiled others laughed
Harry noticed means eldest
group boys seemed look
leader I dont know politics would suit
sir said laughter died away I dont
right kind background one thing A
couple boys around smirked Harry
sure enjoying private joke undoubtedly knew
suspected regarding gang leaders famous ancestor Nonsense said
Slughorn briskly couldnt plainer come decent Wizarding stock abilities
like No youll go far Tom Ive never wrong
student yet The small golden clock standing upon Slughorns
desk chimed eleven oclock behind looked around
Good gracious time already Youd better get going boys
well trouble Lestrange I want essay
morrow detention Same goes Avery
One one boys filed room Slughorn heaved
armchair carried empty glass
desk A movement behind made look around Riddle
still standing Look shar p Tom dont want
caught bed hours prefect
Sir I wanted ask something Ask away
mboy ask away Sir I wondered
know Horcruxes Slughorn stared
thick ringers absentmindedly clawing stem wine
glass Project Defense Against Dark Arts
But Harry could tell Slughorn knew perfectly well
schoolwork Not exactly sir said Riddle I came across
term reading I didnt fully understand No
well youd hardpushed find book
Hogwarts thatll give details Horcruxes Tom thats Dark
stuff Dark indeed said Slughorn But obviously know
sir I mean wizard like — sorry
I mean cant tell obviously — I knew
anyone could tell could — I thought
Id –“ It well done thought Harry
hesitancy casual tone careful flattery none overdone He
Harry much experience trying wheedle information
reluctant people recognize master work He could
tell Riddle wanted information much perhaps
working toward moment weeks Well said Slughorn
looking Riddle fiddling ribbon top
box crystallized pineapple well cant hurt give
overview course Just understand term A
Horcrux word used object person
concealed part soul I dont quite understand
works though sir said Riddle His voice
carefully controlled Harry could sense excitement Well split
soul see said Slughorn hide part
object outside body Then even ones body attacked
destroyed one cannot die part soul remains earthbound
undamaged But course existence form
Slughorns face crumpled Harry found remembering words heard
nearly two years I ripped body I
less spirit less meanest ghost still
I alive would want Tom Death
would preferable But Riddles hunger apparent
expression greedy could longer hide longing
How split soul Well said Slughorn uncomfortably
must understand soul supposed remain intact
whole Splitting n I act violation
nature But By act
evil — supreme act evil By commiting murder Killing
rips soul apart The wizard intent upon creating Horcrux would
use damage advantage He would encase torn portion
— Encase But — There
spell ask I dont know said Slughoin shaking
head like old elephant bothered mosquitoes Do I
look though I tried — I look like
killer No sir course said Riddle quickly
Im sorry I didnt mean offend
Not offended said Slughorn gruffly
It natural feel curiosity things
Wizards certain caliber always drawn
aspect magic Yes sir said Riddle
What I dont understand though — curiosity — I
mean would one Horcrux much use Can split soul
Wouldnt better make stronger soul
pieces I mean instance isnt seven powerfully
magical number wouldnt seven — Merlins beard Tom yelped
Slughorn Seven Isnt bad enough think killing one person
And case bad enough divide
soul rip seven pieces
Slughorn looked deeply troubled He gazing
Riddle though never seen plainly
Harry could tell regretting entering conversation
Of course muttered hypothetical
discussing isnt All academic Yes
sir course said Riddle quickly But
Tom keep quiet Ive told — thats
say weve discussed People wouldnt like think weve
chatting Horcruxes Its banned subject Hogwarts know
Dumbledores particularly fierce I wont
say word sir said Riddle left
Harry glimpsed face full wild
happiness worn first found
wizard sort happiness enhance
handsome features made somehow less human
Thank Harry said Dumbledore quietly Let us go
When Harry landed back office floor Dumbledore
already sitting behind desk Harry sat
waited Dumbledore speak I hoping
piece evidence long time said Dumbledore
last It confirms theory I working
tells I right also far
still go Harry suddenly noticed every
single one old headmasters headmistresses portraits around
walls awake listening conversation A corpulent
red nosed wizard actually taken ear trumpet
Well Harry said Dumbledore I sure understood significance
heard At age
give take months Tom Riddle
could find make immortal You
think succeeded sir asked Harry He made Horcrux And
thats didnt die attacked He
Horcrux hidden somewhere A bit soul safe
A bit said Dumbledore You heard Voldemort particularly
wanted Horace opinion would happen
wizard created one Horcrux would happen
wizard determined evade death would prepared
murder many times rip soul repeatedly store
many separately concealed Horcruxc No book would given
information As far I know — far I sure
Voldemort knew — wizard ever done tear
soul two Dumbledore paused moment marshaling
thought said Four years ago I received I
considered certain proof Voldemort split soul Where
asked Harry How You handed Harry said
Dumbledore The diary Riddles diary one giving instructions
reopen Chamber Secrets I dont understand sir said
Harry Well although I see Riddle
came diary described
phenomenon I never witnessed A mere memory starting act
think A mere memory sapping life
girl whose hands fallen No something much sinister
lived inside book fragment soul I
almost sure The diary Horcrux But
raised many questions answered What intrigued alarmed
diary intended weapon
much safeguard 1 still dont understand said Harry
Well worked Horcrux supposed work
— words fragment soul concealed inside
kept safe undoubtedly played part preventing death
owner But could doubt Riddle really
wanted diary read wanted piece soul inhabit
possess somebody else Slytherins monster would unleashed
Well didnt want hard work wasted
said Harry He wanted people know Slytherins heir
couldnt take credit time Quite correct said
Dumbledore nodding But dont see Harry intended
diary passed planted future Hogwarts student
remarkably blase precious fragment soul concealed
within The point Horcrux Professor Slughorn explained
keep part self hidden safe fling
somebody elses path run risk might
destroy — indeed happened That particular fragment soul
saw The careless way Voldemort
regarded Horcrux seemed ominous It suggested
must made — planning make —
Horcruxes loss first would
detrimental I wish believe nothing else seemed
make sense Then told two years later
night Voldemort returned body made
illuminating alarming statement Death Eaters ‘I gone
anybody along path leads immortality’ That
told said Further anybody And I thought
I knew meant though Death Eaters He
referring Horcruxes Horcruxes plural Harry I
don’t believe wizard ever Yet fitted Lord
Voldomort seemed grow less human passing years
transformation undergone seemed explainable
soul mutilated beyond realms might
call usual evil So hes made
impossible kill murdering people said Harry Why couldnt
make Sorcerers Stone steal one interested
immortality Well know tried
five years ago snl Dumbledore But several reasons
I think Sorcerers Stone would appeal less Horcruxes
Lord Voldemort While Elixir Life indeed extend life
must lie drunk regularly eternity drinker
maintain immortality Therefore Voldemort would entirely dependant Elixir
ran contaminated Stone
stolen would die like man Voldemort likes
operate alone remember I believe would found
thought dependent even Elixir intolerable Of course
prepared drink would take
horrible partlife condemned attacking
regain body Thereafter I convinced intended
continue rely Horcruxes He would need nothing
could regain human form He already immortal
see close immortal man
But Harry armed information crucial memory
succeeded procuring us closer secret
finishing Lord Voldemort anyone ever You heard
Harry Wouldnt better make stronger soul
pieces isnt seven powerfully magical
number Isnt seven powerfully magical number Yes
I think idea sevenpart soul would greatly appeal
Lord Voldemort He made seven Horcruxes said Harry horrorstruck
several portraits walls made similar noises shock
mid outrage But could anywhere world — hidden
— buried invisible — I glad see
appreciate magnitude problem said Dumbledore calmly But firstly
Harry seven Horcruxes six The seventh part soul
however maimed resides inside regenerated body That part
lived spectral existence many years
exile without self That seventh piece
soul last anybody wishing kill Voldemort
must attack — piece lives body But
six Horcruxes said Harry little desperately supposed
find You forgetting already
destroyed one And I destroyed another You
said Harry eagerly Yes indeed said Dumbledore
raised blackened burnedlooking hand The ring Harry Marvolos ring And
terrible curse upon Had —
forgive lack seemly modesty — prodigious
skill Professor Snapes timely action I returned Hogwarts
desperately injured I might lived tell tale However
withered hand seem unreasonable exchange seventh
Voldemorts soul The ring longer Horcrux
But find Well know
many years I made business discover much
I Voldemorts past life I traveled widely visiting
places knew I stumbled across ring hidden
ruin Gaunt’s house It seem Voldemort succeeded
sealing piece soul side
want wear anymore He hid protected many
powerful enchantments shack ancestors lived Morfin
carted Azkaban course never guessing I
might one day take trouble visit ruin
I might keeping eye open traces magical concealment
However congratulate heartily You destroyed diary
I ring right theory
sevenpart soul four Horcruxes remain And could anything
said Harry They could oh tin cans I dunno
empty potion bottles You thinking
Portkeys Harry must ordinary objects easy overlook But would
Lord Voldemort use tin cans old potion bottles guard
precious soul You forgetting I showed Lord
Voldemort liked collect trophies preferred objects powerful
magical history His pride belief superiority determination
carve startling place magical history things
suggest Voldemort would chosen Horcruxr
care favoring objects worthy honor The diary wasnt
special The diary said
proof Hire Slytherin I sure
Voldemort considered stupendous importance So Horcruxes
said Harry Do think know sir
I guess said Dumbledore For reasons I
already given I believe Lord Voldemort would prefer objects
certain grandeur I therefore trawled back Voldemorts
past see I find evidence artifacts
disappeared around The locket said Harry loudly Hufflepuffs cup
Yes said Dumbledore smiling I would prepared bet
— perhaps hand — couple fingers
became Horcruxes three four The remaining two assuming
created total six problem
I hazard guess secured objects Hufflepuff
Slytherin set track objects owned Gryffindor
Ravenclaw Four objects four founders would I sure
exerted powerful pull Voldemorts imagination I cannot answer
whether ever managed find anything Ravenclaws I confident
however known relic Gryffindor remains safe
Dumbledore pointed blackened fingers wall behind
rubyencrusted sword reposed within glass case Do think
thats really wanted come back Hogwarts sir said
Harry To try find something one founders
My thoughts precisely said Dumbledore But unfortunately
advance us much turned away I
believe without chance search school I forced
conclude never fulfilled ambition collecting four founders objects
He definitely two — may found three —
best Even
got something Ravenclaws Gryffindors leaves sixth
Horcrux said Harry counting fingers Unless he’s got
I dont think said Dumbledore I think I know
sixth Horcrux I wonder say I
confess I curious behavior
snake Nagini The snake said Harry startled You
use animals Horcruxes Well inadvisable
said Dumbledore confide part soul
something think move obviously
risky business However calculations correct Voldemort still
least one Horcrux short goal six
entered parents house intention killing He seems
reserved process making Horcruxes particularly significant deaths
You would certainly He believed killing
destroying danger prophecy outlined He believed
making invincible I sure intending
make final Horcrux death As know failed
After interval years however used Nagini kill
old Muggle man might occurred
turn last Horcrux She underlines Slytherin connection
enhances Lord Voldemorts mystique I think perhaps fond
anything certainly likes
keep close seems unusual amount
control even Parselmouth So said Harry
diarys gone rings gone The cup locket
snake still intact think might Horcrux
Ravenclaws Gryffindors An admirably succinct accurate
summary yes said Dumbledore bowing head So
still looking sir Is youve
going youve leaving school Correct said
Dumbledore I looking long time I think
perhaps I may close finding another one
There hopeful signs And said Harry
quickly I come help get rid
Dumbledore looked Harry intently moment
saying Yes I think I said Harry thoroughly
taken aback Oh yes said Dumbledore smiling slightly I think
earned right Harry felt heart lift
It good hear words caution protection
The headmasters headmistresses around walls seemed less impressed
Dumbledores decision Harry saw shaking heads
Phineas Nigellus actually snorted Does Voldemort know Horcrux
destroyed sir Can feel Harry asked ignoring portraits
A interesting question Harry I believe I believe
Voldemort immersed evil crucial parts
detached long feel
Perhaps point death might aware
loss aware
instance diary destroyed forced truth
Lucius Malfoy When Voldemort discovered diary
mutilated robbed powers I told
anger terrible behold But I thought meant
Lucius Malfoy smuggle Hogwarts Yes
years ago sure would able create
Horcruxes still Lucius supposed wait Voldemorts sayso
never received Voldemort vanished shortly giving
diary No doubt thought Lucius would dare
anything Horcrux guard carefully
counting much upon Lucius’s fear master
gone years Lucius believed dead Of course Lucius
know diary really I understand Voldemort
told diary would cause Chamber Secrets reopen
cleverly enchanted Had Lucius known held portion
masters soul hands would undoubtedly treated
reverence — instead went ahead carried
old plan ends By planting diary
upon Arthur Weasleys daughter hoped discredit Arthur get rid
highly incriminating magical object one stroke Ah poor Lucius
Voldemorts fury fact
threw away Horcrux gain fiasco
Ministry last year I would surprised
secretly glad safe Azkaban moment
Harry sat thought moment asked So
Horcruxes destroyed Voldemort couldbe killed Yes I think
said Dumbledore Without Horcruxes Voldemort mortal man
maimed diminished soul Never forget though
soul may damaged beyond repair brain magical powers
remain intact It take uncommon skill power kill
wizard like Voldemort even without Horcruxes But I havent
got uncommon skill power said Harry could stop
Yes said Dumbledore firmly You power
Voldemort never You — I know said Harry
impatiently I love It difficulty stopped
adding Big deal Yes Harry love said
Dumbledore looked though knew perfectly well Harry
refrained saying Which given everything happened
great remarkable thing You still young
understand unusual Harry So prophecy
says Ill power Dark Lord knows
means — love asked Harry feeling little let
Yes — love said Dumbledore But Harry never forget
prophecy says significant Voldemort made I
told end last year Voldemort singled
person would dangerous —
made person would
dangerous But comes
— No doesnt said Dumbledore sounding impatient Pointing
Harry black withered hand said You setting
much store prophecy But spluttered Harry
said prophecy means —“ If Voldemort never heard
prophecy would fulfilled Would meant
anything Of course Ho think every prophecy Hall
Prophecy fulfilled But said Harry bewildered
last year said one us would kill
— Harry Harry Voldemort made grave
error acted Professor Trelawneys words If Voldemort never murdered
father would imparted furious desire
revenge Of course If forced mother
die would given magical protection
could penetrate Of course Harry Dont see Voldemort
created worst enemy tyrants everywhere Have
idea much tyrants fear people oppress All
realize one day amongst many victims sure
one rises strikes back Voldemort
different Always lookout one would
challenge He heard prophecy leapt action
result handpicked man likely
finish handed uniquely deadly weapons But —
It essential understand said Dumbledore standing
striding room glittering robes swooshing
wake Harry never seen agitated By attempting kill
Voldemort singled remarkable person sits
front gave tools job It
Voldemorts fault able see thoughts
ambitions even understand snakelike language
gives orders yet Harry despite privileged insight Voldemorts world
incidentally gift Death Eater would kill
never seduced Dark Arts never even
second shown slightest desire become one Voldemorts followers
Of course I havent said Harry indignantly He killed
mum dad You protected short
ability love said Dumbledore loudly The protection possibly
work lure power like Voldemorts In spite
temptation endured suffering remain pure
heart pure age eleven
stared mirror reflected hearts desire
showed way thwart Lord Voldemort
immortality riches Harry idea wizards could
seen saw mirror Voldemort known
dealing But
knows You flitted Lord Voldemorts mind without damage
cannot possess without enduring mortal agony
discovered Ministry I think understands
Harry hurry mutilate
soul never paused understand incomparable power
soul untarnished whole But sir said Harry
making valiant efforts sound argumentative comes
thing doesnt Ive got try kill
— Got said Dumbledore Of course youve got
But prophecy Because never rest
youve tried We know Imagine please

Entrance Hall Dumbledore waiting beside oaken front doors He turned
Harry came skidding topmost stone step panting
hard searing stitch side I would like

stone steps travelling cloak barely
stirring still summer air Harry hurried alongside
Invisibility Cloak still panting sweating rather lot But
people think see leaving Professor Harry asked mind
Malfoy Snape That I Hogsmeade

Hagrids cabin It difficult believe heading
anything dangerous frightening Professor said Harry quietly gates
bottom drive came view
Apparating Yes said Dumbledore You Apparate I believe Yes said
Harry I havent got licence He felt best
honest spoiled everything turning hundred
miles supposed go No matter said Dumbledore
I assist They turned gates
twilit deserted lane Hogsmeade Darkness descended fast walked
time reached High Street night falling
earnest Lights twinkled windows shops neared
Three Broomsticks heard raucous shouting stay shouted
Madam Rosmerta forcibly ejecting grubbylooking wizard Oh hello Albus youre
late Good evening Rosmerta good evening forgive Im
Hogs Head offence I feel like
quieter atmosphere tonight A minute later turned corner
side street Hogs Heads sign creaked little though
breeze In contrast Three Broomsticks pub
appeared completely empty It necessary us
enter muttered Dumbledore glancing around As long nobody sees us
go place hand upon arm Harry There
need grip hard I merely guiding On
count three one two three Harry turned
At horrible sensation squeezed
thick rubber tube could draw breath every part
compressed almost past endurance
thought must suffocate invisible bands seemed burst open
standing cool darkness breathing lungfuls fresh salty air
Harry could smell salt hear rushing waves light chilly
breeze ruffled hair looked moonlit sea
starstrewn sky He standing upon high outcrop dark rock
water foaming churning He glanced shoulder A
towering cliff stood behind sheer drop black faceless A
large chunks rock one upon Harry
Dumbledore standing looked though broken away
cliff face point past It
bleak harsh view sea rock unrelieved tree
sweep grass sand What think asked Dumbledore
He might asking Harrys opinion whether
good site picnic They brought kids orphanage
asked Harry could imagine less cozy spot
day trip Not precisely said Dumbledore There village
sorts halfway along cliffs behind us I believe
orphans taken little sea air view
waves No I think ever Tom Riddle
youthful victims visited spot No Muggle could reach
rock unless uncommonly good mountaineers boats cannot approach
cliffs waters around dangerous I imagine
Riddle climbed magic would served better ropes And
brought two small children probably pleasure terrorizing
I think journey alone would done dont
Harry looked cliff felt goose bumps But
final destination — — lies little farther
Come Dumbledore beckoned Harry edge rock
series jagged niches made footholds leading boulders
lay halfsubmerged water closer cliff It
treacherous descent Dumbledore hampered slightly withered hand moved slowly
The lower rocks slippery seawater Harry could feel flecks
cold salt spray hitting face Lumos said Dumbledore reached
boulder closest cliff face A thousand flecks golden
light sparkled upon dark surface water feet
crouched black wall rock beside
illuminated You see said Dumbledore quietly holding wand little
higher Harry saw fissure cliff dark water
swirling You object getting little wet No
said Harry Then take Invisibility Cloak —
need — let us take plunge And
sudden agility much younger man Dumbledore slid
boulder landed sea began swim
perfect breaststroke toward dark slit rock face lit
wand held teeth Harry pulled cloak stuffed
pocket followed The water icy Harrys waterlogged clothes
billowed around weighed Taking deep breaths filled
nostrils tang salt seaweed struck
shimmering shrinking light moving deeper cliff The
fissure soon opened dark tunnel Harry could tell would
filled water high tide The slimy walls barely
three feet apart glimmered like wet tar passing light
Dumbledores wand A little way passageway curved
left Harry saw extended far cliff He
continued swim Dumbledores wake tips benumbed fingers
brushing rough wet rock Then saw Dumbledore rising
water ahead silver hair dark robes gleaming When Harry
reached spot found steps led large cave
He clambered water streaming soaking clothes emerged
shivering uncontrollably still freezing air Dumbledore standing
middle cave wand held high turned
slowly spot examining walls ceiling Yes
place said Dumbledore How tell Harry spoke
whisper It known magic said Dumbledore simply Harry could tell
whether shivers experiencing due spinedeep coldness
awareness enchantments He watched Dumbledore continued
revolve spot evidently concentrating things Harry could
see This merely antechamber entrance hall said Dumbledore
moment two We need penetrate inner place
Now Lord Voldemorts obstacles stand
way rather nature made Dumbledore approached
wall cave caressed blackened fingertips murmuring
words strange tongue Harry understand Twice Dumbledore
walked right around cave touching much rough rock
could occasionally pausing running fingers backward forward
particular spot finally stopped hand pressed flat
wall Here said We go The entrance
concealed Harry ask Dumbledore knew He never
seen wizard work things like simply looking
touching Harry long since learned bangs smoke
often marks ineptitude expertise Dumbledore stepped back
cave wall pointed wand rock For
moment arched outline appeared blazing white though
powerful light behind crack Youve ddone said Harry
chattering teeth words left lips outline
gone leaving rock bare solid ever Dumbledore
looked around Harry Im sorry I forgot said
pointed wand Harry Harrys clothes
warm dry hanging front
blazing fire Thank said Harry gratefully Dumbledore already
turned attention back solid cave wall He
try magic simply stood staring intently
though something extremely interesting written Harry stayed quite
still want break Dumbledores concentration Then two
solid minutes Dumbledore said quietly Oh surely So crude What
Professor I rather think said Dumbledore putting uninjured hand inside
robes drawing short silver knife kind
Harry used chop potion ingredients required make
payment pass Payment said Harry Youve got give door
something Yes said Dumbledore Blood I much mistaken Blood
I said crude said Dumbledore sounded disdainful even disappointed
though Voldemort fallen short higher standards Dumbledore expected The
idea I sure gathered
enemy must weaken enter Once Lord Voldemort
fails grasp much terrible things physical
injury Yeah still avoid
said Harry experienced enough pain keen
Sometimes however unavoidable said Dumbledore shaking back sleeve
robes exposing forearm injured hand Professor
protested Harry hurrying forward Dumbledore raised knife Ill
Im — He know going say
— younger fitter But Dumbledore merely smiled There flash
silver spurt scarlet rock face peppered
dark glistening drops You kind Harry said Dumbledore passing
tip wand deep cut made
arm healed instantly Snape
healed Malfoys wound But blood worth mine
Ah seems done trick doesnt The blazing
silver outline arch appeared wall
time fade away The bloodspattered rock within
simply vanished leaving opening seemed total darkness After
I think said Dumbledore walked archway
Harry heels lighting wand hastily went
An eerie sight met eyes They standing edge
great black lake vast Harry could make
distant banks cavern high ceiling
sight A misty greenish light shone far away
looked like middle lake reflected
completely still water The greenish glow light
two wands things broke otherwise
velvety blackness though rays penetrate far Harry
would expected The darkness somehow denser normal darkness Let
us walk said Dumbledore quietly Be careful step
water Stay close He set around edge
lake Harry followed close behind Their footsteps made
echoing slapping sounds narrow rim rock surrounded
water On walked view vary
one side rough cavern wall
boundless expanse smooth glassy blackness middle
mysterious greenish glow Harry found place
silence oppressive unnerving Professor said finally Do think Horcrux
Oh yes said Dumbledore Yes Im sure The
question get We couldnt couldnt
try Summoning Charm Harry said sure
stupid suggestion But much keener prepared
admit getting place soon possible Certainly
could said Dumbledore stopping suddenly Harry almost walked
Why dont Me Oh okay
Harry expected cleared throat
said loudly wand aloft Accio Horcrux With noise like
explosion something large pale erupted dark water
twenty feet away Harry could see
vanished crashing splash made great deep ripples
mirrored surface Harry leapt backward shock hit
wall heart still thundering turned Dumbledore What
Something I think ready respond
attempt seize Horcrux Harry looked back water The
surface lake shining black glass The ripples
vanished unnaturally fast Harrys heart however still pounding Did
think would happen sir I thought something would happen
made obvious attempt get hands Horcrux That
good idea Harry much simplest way finding
facing But dont know thing
said Harry looking sinisterly smooth water What things
mean said Dumbledore I doubt much
one Shall walk Professor Yes Harry Do
think going go lake Into
Only unfortunate You dont think Horcrux
bottom Oh I think Horcrux
middle And Dumbledore pointed toward misty green light
center lake So going cross
lake get Yes I think Harry
say anything His thoughts water monsters giant
serpents demons kelpies sprites Aha said Dumbledore
stopped time Harry really walk
moment toppled edge dark water
Dumbledores uninjured hand closed tightly around upper arm pulling
back So sorry Harry I given warning Stand back
wall please I think I found place Harry
idea Dumbledore meant patch dark bank exactly
like every bit far could tell Dumbledore
seemed detected something special This time
running hand rocky wall hrough
thin air though expecting find grip something invisible Oho
said Dumbledore happily seconds later His hand closed midair upon
something Harry could see Dumbledore moved closer water Harry
watched nervously tips Dumbledores buckled shoes found utmost
edge rock rim Keeping hand clenched midair Dumbledore
raised wand tapped fist
point Immediately thick coppery green chain appeared thin air
extending depths water Dumbledores clenched hand Dumbledore
tapped chain began slide fist like
snake coiling ground clinking sound echoed
noisily rocky walls pulling something depths
black water Harry gasped ghostly prow tiny boat
broke surface glowing green chain floated
barely ripple toward place bank Harry
Dumbledore stood How know Harry asked
astonishment Magic always leaves traces said Dumbledore boat hit
bank gentle bump sometimes distinctive traces I taught Tom
Riddle I know style Is boat safe Oh
yes I think Voldemort needed create means cross
lake without attracting wrath creatures placed
within case ever wanted visit remove
Horcrux So things water wont anything us
cross Voldemorts boat I think must resign
fact point realize
Lord Voldemort Thus far however done well They
allowed us raise boat But let us
asked Harry could shake vision tentacles rising
dark water moment sight
bank Voldemort would reasonably confident none
great wizard would able find boat
said Dumbledore I think would prepared risk
mind unlikely possibility somebody else would
find knowing set obstacles ahead
would able penetrate We shall see whether
right Harry looked boat It really small
It doesnt look like built two people Will
hold us Will heavy together Dumbledore chuckled
Voldemort cared weight amount
magical power crossed lake I rather think enchantment
placed upon boat one wizard
time able sail But
— I think count Harry You
underage unqualified Voldemort would never expected sixteenyearold reach
place I think unlikely powers register compared
mine These words nothing raise Harrys morale perhaps Dumbledore
knew added Voldemorts mistake Harry Voldemorts mistake
Age foolish forgetful underestimates youth
Now first time careful touch
water Dumbledore stood aside Harry climbed carefully boat Dumbledore
stepped coiling chain onto floor They crammed
together Harry could comfortably sit crouched knees jutting
edge boat began move
There sound silken rustle boats
prow cleaving water moved without help though
invisible rope pulling onward toward light center
Soon could longer see walls cavern
might sea except waves Harry
looked saw reflected gold wandlight sparkling
glittering black water passed The boat carving
deep ripples upon glassy surface grooves dark mirror
And Harry saw marble white floating inches
surface Professor said startled voice echoed loudly
silent water Harry I think I saw hand
water — human hand Yes I sure said
Dumbledore calmly Harry stared water looking vanished
hand sick feeling rose throat So thing
jumped water — But Harry
answer Dumbledore could reply wandlight slid fresh
patch water showed time dead man lying
faceup inches beneath surface open eyes misted though
cobwebs hair robes swirling around like smoke There
bodies said Harry voice sounded much higher
usual unlike Yes said Dumbledore placidly
need worry moment At
moment Harry repeated tearing gaze water look
Dumbledore Not merely drifting peacefully us said
Dumbledore There nothing feared body Harry
anything feared darkness Lord
Voldemort course secretly fears disagrees But
reveals lack wisdom It unknown fear
look upon death darkness nothing Harry said nothing
want argue found idea
bodies floating around beneath horrible
believe dangerous But
one jumped said trying make voice
level calm Dumbledores When I tried Summon Horcrux
body leapt lake Yes said Dumbledore I
sure take Horcrux shall find less
peaceable However like many creatures dwell cold darkness
fear light warmth shall therefore call aid
need arise Fire Harry Dumbledore added smile
response Harrys bewildered expression Oh right
said Harry quickly He turned head look greenish
glow toward boat still inexorably sailing He could
pretend scared The great black lake teeming
dead It seemed hours hours ago
met Professor Trelawney given Ron Hermione Felix
Felicis He suddenly wished said better
goodbye hadnt seen Ginny
Nearly said Dumbledore cheerfully Sure enough greenish
light seemed growing larger last within minutes
boat come halt bumping gently something Harry
could see first raised illuminated wand
saw reached small island smooth rock
center lake Careful touch water
said Dumbledore Harry climbed boat The island
larger Dumbledores office expanse flat dark stone
stood nothing source greenish light
looked much brighter viewed close Harry squinted
first thought lamp kind
saw light coming stone basin rather
like Pensieve set top pedestal Dumbledore
approached basin Harry followed Side side looked
The basin full emerald liquid emitting
phosphorescent glow What asked Harry quietly I sure

back sleeve robe blackened hand stretched
tips burned fingers toward surface

smiling faintly See I cannot approach nearer You try
Staring Harry put hand basin attempted touch

Hogwarts yet realised anything wrong Harry put
Invisibility Cloak Harry pulled Cloak pocket threw
mounting broom Madam Rosmerta already tottering
back towards pub Harry Dumbledore kicked
ground rose air As sped towards
castle Harry glanced sideways Dumbledore ready grab
fall sight Dark Mark seemed acted
upon Dumbledore like stimulant bent low broom
eyes fixed upon Mark long silver hair beard
flying behind night air And Harry looked ahead

Then light Mark saw Dumbledores wand flying

Dumbledore wordlessly immobilised Harry second taken

ramparts white face Dumbledore still showed
sign panic distress He merely looked across disarmer
said Good evening Draco Malfoy stepped forwards glancing around quickly

details rise power widely known hereEducated
Durmstrang school famous even unfortunate tolerance
Dark Arts Grindelwald showed quite precociously brilliant Dumbledore
Rather channel abilities attainment awards prizes
however Gellert Grindelwald devoted pursuits At sixteen years old
even Durmstrang felt could longer turn blind eye
twisted experiments Gellert Grindelwald expelledHitherto

Secrecy establishing Wizard rule Muggles What blow

speeches promoting Muggle rights seem light damning

power mourning mother caring

pedestal bleat put plans

came senses However truth seems altogether shockingBarely
two months great new friendship Dumbledore Grindelwald parted never
see met legendary duel
see chapter 22 What caused abrupt rupture Had Dumbledore
come senses Had told Grindelwald wanted
part plans Alas noIt poor little Ariana dying I
think says Bathilda It came awful shock
Gellert house happened came
back house dither told wanted
go home next day Terribly distressed know So I
arranged Portkey last I saw himAlbus
beside Arianas death It dreadful
two brothers They lost everybody except No wonder
tempers ran little high Aberforth blamed Albus know people
dreadful circumstances But Aberforth always talked little madly poor
boy All breaking Albuss nose funeral
decent It would destroyed Kendra see sons fighting like
across daughters body A shame Gellert could stayed
funeral He would comfort Albus
leastThis dreadful coffinside brawl known attended Ariana
Dumbledores funeral raises several questions Why exactly Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus
sisters death Was Batty pretends mere effusion
grief Or could concrete reason
fury Grindelwald expelled Durmstrang nearfatal attacks upon fellow
students fled country hours girls death Albus
shame fear never saw forced
pleas Wizarding worldNeither Dumbledore Grindelwald

His head still tilted one side like curious child
wondering would happen proceeded Harry looked back
red eyes wanted happen quickly could

mouth move flash green light everything gone
He lay facedown listening silence He perfectly alone Nobody
watching Nobody else He perfectly sure
himselfA long time later maybe time
came must exist must
disembodied thought lying definitely lying surface
Therefore sense touch thing
lay existed tooAlmost soon reached conclusion
Harry became conscious naked Convinced
total solitude concern intrigue
slightly He wondered whether could feel would
able see In opening discovered eyesHe
lay bright mist though like mist
ever experienced His surroundings hidden cloudy vapor
rather cloudy vapor yet formed surroundings The floor
lay seemed white neither warm cold
simply flat blank something beHe sat
His body appeared unscathed He touched face He
wearing glasses anymoreThen noise reached unformed nothingness
surrounded small soft thumpings something flapped flailed
struggled It pitiful noise yet also slightly indecent He
uncomfortable feeling eavesdropping something furtive shamefulFor
first time wished clothedBarely wish formed
head robes appeared short distance away He took
pulled They soft clean warm It
extraordinary appeared like moment

Requirement The longer looked see
A great domed glass roof glittered high sunlight Perhaps

Dumbledore walking toward sprightly upright wearing sweeping robes
midnight blueHarry He spread arms wide hands
whole white undamaged You wonderful boy You brave brave man
Let us walkStunned Harry followed Dumbledore strode away
flayed child lay whimpering leading two seats Harry
previously noticed set distance away high sparkling ceiling
Dumbledore sat one Harry fell
staring old headmasters face Dumbledores long silver hair
beard piercingly blue eyes behind halfmoon spectacles crooked nose Everything
remembered And yetBut youre dead said HarryOh
yes said Dumbledore matteroffactlyThen Im dead tooAh said Dumbledore smiling still
broadly That question isnt On whole dear boy

said Harry Didnt IYou said Dumbledore nodding Go onSo part
soul meDumbledore nodded still enthusiastically urging
Harry onward broad smile encouragement face

completely HarryBut thenHarry trembled shoulder
small maimed creature trembled chairWhat ProfessorSomething
beyond either help said DumbledoreBut Voldemort used Killing
Curse Harry started nobody died time ¨C

indeed palace sat odd
one chairs set little rows bits railing

lips easily without effortHe took blood said HarryPrecisely said Dumbledore
He took blood rebuilt living body Your
blood veins Harry Lilys protection inside He
tethered life livesI live lives But
I thought I thought way around I thought

distracted whimpering thumping agonized creature behind
glanced back yet againAre sure cant
anythingThere help possibleThen explain said Harry Dumbledore smiledYou
seventh Horcrux Harry Horcrux never meant make
He rendered soul unstable broke apart
committed acts unspeakable evil murder parents
attempted killing child But escaped room
even less knew He left body
behind He left part latched wouldbe victim
survivedAnd knowledge remained woefully incomplete Harry That Voldemort
value takes trouble comprehend Of houseelves
childrens tales love loyalty innocence Voldemort knows understands nothing
Nothing That power beyond power
beyond reach magic truth never
graspedHe took blood believing would strengthen He took
body tiny part enchantment mother laid upon
died His body keeps sacrifice alive
enchantment survives Voldemorts
one last hope himselfDumbledore smiled Harry Harry stared
himAnd knew You knew ¨C alongI guessed But
guesses usually good said Dumbledore happily sat
silence seemed like long time creature behind
continued whimper trembleTheres said Harry Theres
Why wand break wand borrowedAs
I cannot sureHave guess said Harry Dumbledore laughedWhat
must understand Harry Lord Voldemort journeyed
together realms magic hitherto unknown untested But
I think happened unprecedented wandmaker could
I think ever predicted explained VoldemortWithout meaning
know Lord Voldemort doubled bond
returned human form A part soul
still attached thinking strengthen took
part mothers sacrifice If could
understood precise terrible power sacrifice would
perhaps dared touch blood But
able understand could Lord Voldemort might
never murdered allHaving ensured twofold connection wrapped
destinies together securely ever two wizards joined history
Voldemort proceeded attack wand shared core
And something strange happened know The
cores reacted way Lord Voldemort never knew
wand twin ever expectedHe
afraid night Harry You accepted even embraced
possibility death something Lord Voldemort never able
Your courage wand overpowered And
something happened wands something echoed relationship
mastersI believe wand imbibed power qualities
Voldemorts wand night say contained
little Voldemort So wand recognized
pursued recognized man kin mortal enemy
regurgitated magic magic much
powerful anything Luciuss wand ever performed Your wand contained
power enormous courage Voldemorts deadly skill
What chance poor stick Lucius Malfoys standBut
wand powerful come Hermione able break
asked HarryMy dear boy remarkable effects directed Voldemort
tampered illadvisedly deepest laws magic Only
toward wand abnormally powerful Otherwise wand
like though good one I sure Dumbledore finished
kindlyHarry sat thought long time perhaps seconds It
hard sure things like time hereHe killed
wandHe failed kill wand Dumbledore
corrected Harry I think agree dead
¨C though course added fearing
discourteous I minimize sufferings I sure
severeI feel great moment though said Harry looking
clean unblemished hands Where exactlyWell I going
ask said Dumbledore looking around Where would say
areUntil Dumbledore asked Harry known Now however
found answer ready giveIt looks said
slowly like Kings Cross station Except lo cleaner empty
trains far I seeKings Cross station
Dumbledore chuckling immoderately Good gracious reallyWell think
asked Harry little defensivelyMy dear boy I idea
This say partyHarry idea
meant Dumbledore infuriating He glared remembered
much pressing question current locationThe Deathly Hallows
said glad see words wiped
smile Dumbledores faceAh yes said He even looked
little worriedWellFor first time since Harry met Dumbledore looked
less old man much less He looked fleetingly like
small boy caught wrongdoingCan forgive said Can
forgive trusting For telling Harry I
feared would fail I failed I
dreaded would make mistakes I crave pardon Harry
I known time better
manWhat talking asked Harry startled Dumbledores tone
sudden tears eyesThe Hallows Hallows murmured Dumbledore A
desperate mans dreamBut theyre realReal dangerous lure fools
said Dumbledore And I fool But know dont
I secrets anymore You knowWhat I
knowDumbledore turned whole body face Harry tears still sparkled
brilliantly blue eyesMaster death Harry master Death Was
I better ultimately VoldemortOf course said Harry Of course
¨C ask You never killed could
avoid itTrue true said Dumbledore like child seeking
reassurance Yet I sought way conquer death HarryNot
way said Harry After anger Dumbledore
odd sit beneath high vaulted ceiling
defend Dumbledore Hallows HorcruxesHallows murmured Dumbledore Horcruxes PreciselyThere
pause The creature behind whimpered Harry longer
looked aroundGrindelwald looking askedDumbledore closed eyes
moment noddedIt thing drew
us together said quietly Two clever arrogant boys shared
obsession He wanted come Godrics Hollow I sure
guessed grave Ignotus Peverell He wanted
explore place third brother diedSo true asked
Harry All The Peverell brothers ¨C ¨C
three brothers tale said Dumbledore nodding Oh yes I think
Whether met Death lonely road I think
likely Peverell brothers simply gifted dangerous wizards
succeeded creating powerful objects The story Deaths
Hallows seems sort legend might
sprung around creationsThe Cloak know traveled
ages father son mother daughter right
Ignotuss last living descendant born Ignotus
village Godrics HollowDumbledore smiled HarryMeYou You guessed I know
Cloak possession night parents died
James showed days previously It
explained much undetected wrongdoing school I could hardly believe
I seeing I asked borrow examine
I long since given dream uniting Hallows
I could resist could help taking closer look
It Cloak likes I never seen
immensely old perfect every respect father died
I two Hallows last myselfHis tone unbearably
bitterThe Cloak wouldnt helped survive though Harry said quickly Voldemort
knew mum dad The Cloak couldnt made
curseproofTrue sighed Dumbledore TrueHarry waited Dumbledore speak
prompted himSo youd given looking Hallows
saw CloakOh yes said Dumbledore faintly It seemed forced
meet Harrys eyes You know happened You know You
cannot despise I despise myselfBut I dont despise
¨C Then said Dumbledore He drew deep breath You
know secret sisters ill health Muggles
became You know poor father sought revenge
paid price died In Azkaban You know mother gave
life care ArianaI resented HarryDumbledore stated
baldly coldly He looking top Harrys
head distanceI gifted I brilliant I wanted
escape I wanted shine I wanted gloryDo misunderstand
said pain crossed face looked ancient
I loved I loved parents I loved brother
sister I selfish Harry selfish
remarkably selfless person could possibly imagineSo mother
died I left responsibility damaged sister
wayward brother I returned village anger bitterness
Trapped wasted I thought And course cameDumbledore looked
directly Harrys eyes againGrindelwald You cannot imagine ideas caught
Harry inflamed Muggles forced subservience We wizards triumphant Grindelwald
I glorious young leaders revolutionOh I
scruples I assuaged conscience empty words It would
greater good harm done would repaid
hundredfold benefits wizards Did I know heart
hearts Gellert Grindelwald I think I I
closed eyes If plans making came fruition
dreams would come trueAnd heart schemes
Deathly Hallows How fascinated fascinated
us The unbeatable wand weapon would lead us power
The Resurrection Stone ¨C though I pretended know
meant army Inferi To I confess
meant return parents lifting responsibility
shouldersAnd Cloak somehow never discussed Cloak much
Harry Both us could conceal well enough without Cloak
true magic course
used protect shield others well owner I
thought ever found might useful
hiding Ariana interest Cloak mainly
completed trio legend said man
united three objects would truly master death
took mean invincibleInvincible masters death Grindelwald Dumbledore Two
months insanity cruel dreams neglect two
members family left meAnd know happened
Reality returned form rough unlettered infinitely
admirable brother I want hear truths shouted
I want hear I could
set forth seek Hallows fragile unstable sister
towThe argument became fight Grindelwald lost control That I
always sensed though I pretended sprang
terrible And Ariana mothers care caution lay
dead upon floorDumbledore gave little gasp began cry
earnest Harry reached glad find
could touch He gripped arm tightly Dumbledore gradually regained
controlWell Grindelwald fled anyone I could predicted He vanished
plans seizing power schemes Muggle torture
dreams Deathly Hallows dreams I encouraged
helped He ran I left bury
sister learn live guilt terrible
grief price shameYears passed There rumors
They said procured wand immense power I meanwhile
offered post Minister Magic several
times Naturally I refused I learned I
trusted powerBut youd better much better Fudge
Scimgeour burst HarryWould I asked Dumbledore heavily I
sure I proven young man power
weakness temptation It curious thing Harry
perhaps best suited power
never sought Those like leadership thrust upon
take mantle must find
surprise wear wellI safer Hogwarts
I think I good teacher ¨C You best
¨C¨C kind Harry But I busied
training young wizards Grindelwald raising army They say
feared perhaps less I think
I feared himOh death said Dumbledore answer Harrys questioning
look Not could magically I knew
evenly matched perhaps I shade skillful
It truth I feared You see I never knew
us last horrific fight actually cast curse
killed sister You may call cowardly You would
right Harry I dreaded beyond things knowledge
I brought death merely arrogance
stupidity I actually struck blow snuffed
lifeI think knew I think knew frightened
I delayed meeting finally would
shameful resist longer People dying seemed unstoppable
I I couldWell know happened
next I duel I wandAnother silence Harry
ask whether Dumbledore ever found struck Ariana dead
He want know even less want
Dumbledore tell At last knew Dumbledore
would seen looked mirror Erised
Dumbledore understanding fascination exercised
HarryThey sat silence long time whipmerings
creature behind barely disturbed Harry anymoreAt last said
Grindelwald tried stop Voldemort going wand He lied
know pretended never itDumbledore nodded looking
lap tears still glittering crooked noseThey say showed remorse
later years alone cell Nurmengard I hope
true I would like think feel
horror shame done Perhaps lie
Voldemort attempt make amends prevent Voldemort taking
Hallowor maybe breaking tomb suggested Harry Dumbledore
dabbed eyesAfter another short pause Harry said You tried use
Resurrection StoneDumbledore noddedWhen I discovered years buried
abandoned home Gaunts ¨C Hallow I
craved though youth I wanted
different reasons ¨C I lost head Harry I quite
forgot I Horcrux ring sure
carry curse I picked I put
second I imagined I
see Ariana mother father tell
sorry I wasI fool Harry After
years I learned nothing I unworthy unite
Deathly Hallows I proved time
final proofWhy said Harry It natural You wanted see
Whats wrong thatMaybe man million could
unite Hallows Harry I fit possess meanest
least extraordinary I fit Elder
Wand boast kill
I permitted tame use I took
gain save others itBut Cloak I took
vain curiousity could never worked
works true owners The stone I
would used attempt drag back
peace rather enable selfsacrifice You
worthy possessor HallowsDumbledore patted Harrys hand Harry looked
old man smiled could help
How could remain angry Dumbledore nowWhy
make difficultDumbledores smile tremulousI afraid I counted
Miss Granger slow Harry I afraid
hot head might dominate good heart I scared
presented outright facts tempting objects might seize
Hallows I wrong time wrong
reasons If laid hands I wanted possess
safely You true master death true
master seek run away Death He accepts
must die understands far far worse things
living world dyingAnd Voldemort never knew HallowsI
think recognize Resurrection Stone
turned Horcrux But even known
Harry I doubt would interested
except first He would think needed Cloak
stone would want bring back
dead He fears dead He loveBut
expected go wandI sure
would try ever since wand beat Voldemorts graveyard
Little Hangleton At first afraid conquered
superior skill Once kidnapped Ollivander however discovered
existence twin cores He thought explained everything Yet
borrowed wand better So Voldemort instead asking
quality made wand
strong gift possessed naturally set
find one wand said would beat
For Elder Wand become obsession rival
obsession He believes Elder Wand removes
last weakness makes truly invincible Poor SeverusIf planned
death Snape meant end Elder
Wand didnt youI admit intention said Dumbledore
work I intended itNo said Harry That bit
didnt work outThe creature behind jerked moaned Harry
Dumbledore sate without talking longest time yet The realization
would happen next settled gradually Harry long minutes
like softly falling snowIve got go back havent IThat
youIve got choiceOh yes Dumbledore smiled We
Kings Cross say I think decided
go back would able lets say board
trainAnd would take meOn said Dumbledore simplySilence againVoldemorts got
Elder WandTrue Voldemort Elder WandBut want go
backI think said Dumbledore choose return
chance may finished good I cannot promise
But I know Harry less fear
returning doesHarry glanced raw looking
thing trembled choked shadow beneath distant chairDo
pity dead Harry Pity living
live without love By returning may ensure fewer souls
maimed fewer families torn apart If seems
worthy goal saw goodbye presentHarry nodded
sighed Leaving place would nearly hard walking
forest warm light
peaceful knew heading back pain
fear loss He stood Dumbledore
looked long moment others
facesTell one last thing said Harry Is real Or
happening inside headDumbledore beamed voice
sounded loud strong Harrys ears even though bright mist
descending obscuring figureOf course happening inside
head Harry earth mean real
