              "\"HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's Stone\\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\nHarry Potter\\n&\\nThe Sorcerer’s Stone\\nby J.K. RowlingHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER ONE\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\\nM r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\\nyou’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\\ndidn’t hold with such nonsense.\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\\nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\\nusual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\\ntime craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\\nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they\\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\\nDursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\\npretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\\nhusband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\\nto think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\\nDursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\\nseen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\\ndidn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\\nhummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\\n“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\\nand backed out of number four’s drive.\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign ofsomething peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t\\nrealize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There\\nwas a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in\\nsight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\\nlight. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\\ndrove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\\nnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\\ncat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that\\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\\nDursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you\\nsaw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\\nDursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\\nstunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would\\nbe it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\\nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\nninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\\nthat morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\\npeople down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\\nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\\nDursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\\nmore. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch\\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\nHe’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\\nthem next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know\\nwhy, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\\nhe couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\\nclutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\\nwere saying.\\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”“ — yes, their son, Harry —”\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\\ndialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\\ndown and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter\\nwasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\\nwho had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew\\nwas called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\\nHarold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\\nany mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…\\nbut all the same, those people in cloaks.…\\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\\nhe left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\\ninto someone just outside the door.\\n“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\\na few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\\ncloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\\ncontrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\\npassersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\\nRejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\\nshould be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\\nwas rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\\nthings, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of\\nimagination.\\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —\\nand it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It\\nwas now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\\nsame markings around its eyes.\\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\\nbehavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\\ninto the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley hadlearned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\\nhad been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\\non the evening news:\\n“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s\\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\\nof these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The\\nnewscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\\nJim?”\\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not\\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\\nYorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\\npromised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\\nhave been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But\\nI can promise a wet night tonight.”\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\\nwhisper, a whisper about the Potters.…\\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\\nno good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er\\n— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”\\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\\nthey normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\\n“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting\\nstars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”\\n“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.\\n“Well, I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you\\nknow…her crowd.”\\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\\nwhether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t\\ndare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about\\nDudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”\\n“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”\\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”\\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quiteagree.”\\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\\nWhile Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\\nwindow and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\\nstaring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\\nPotters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t\\nthink he could bear it.\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\\nbefore he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\\nreason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\\nwhat he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he\\nand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he\\nyawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…\\nHow very wrong he was.\\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\\nthe wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\\nstatue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so\\nmuch as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\nsuddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.\\nThe cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\\nlong enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\\nswept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\\nand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was\\nAlbus Dumbledore.\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\\nhe was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\\ncat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. Thenearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next\\nlamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\\nonly lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\\nwere the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\\nnow, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that\\nwas happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\\ninside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\\ndown on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he\\nspoke to it.\\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\\na rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\\ncloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\\ndistinctly ruffled.\\n“How did you know it was me?” she asked.\\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\\n“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.”\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\n“Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think\\nthey’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed\\nsomething’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the\\nDursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting\\nstars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\\nsomething. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\\nnever had much sense.”\\n“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious\\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.”\\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason\\nto lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\\nbroad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\\nhoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine\\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\\nat last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\\nDumbledore?”“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful\\nfor. Would you care for a lemon drop?”\\n“A what?”\\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”\\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t\\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who\\nhas gone —”\\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by\\nhis name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been\\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor\\nMcGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\\nseemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-\\nWho.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s\\nname.”\\n“I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\nexasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the\\nonly one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”\\n“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will\\nnever have.”\\n“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”\\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.”\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The\\nowls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\\nthey’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?”\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\\nanxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a\\npiercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying,\\nshe was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\\nDumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort\\nturned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily\\nand James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n“Lily and James…I can’t believe it…I didn’t want to believe it…Oh,\\nAlbus…”\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know…I\\nknow…” he said heavily.Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all.\\nThey’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He\\ncouldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that\\nwhen he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and\\nthat’s why he’s gone.”\\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\\n“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done…\\nall the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding…of\\nall the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”\\n“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve\\nhands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\\nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\\npocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by\\nthe way?”\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to\\ntell me why you’re here, of all places?”\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family\\nhe has left now.”\\n“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried\\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\\n“Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find\\ntwo people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking\\nhis mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come\\nand live here!”\\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and\\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written\\nthem a letter.”\\n“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\\nthe wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?\\nThese people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I\\nwouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future —\\nthere will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know\\nhis name!”\\n“Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\\nhalf-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before\\nhe can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can yousee how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready\\nto take it?”\\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,\\nand then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting\\nhere, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might\\nbe hiding Harry underneath it.\\n“Hagrid’s bringing him.”\\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as\\nthis?”\\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend\\nto — what was that?”\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge\\nmotorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.\\nHe was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He\\nlooked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black\\nhair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and\\nhis feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms\\nhe was holding a bundle of blankets.\\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did\\nyou get that motorcycle?”\\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing\\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve\\ngot him, sir.”\\n“No problems, were there?”\\n“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before\\nthe Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over\\nBristol.”\\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-\\nblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of\\nlightning.\\n“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”\\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well —\\ngive him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”\\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’\\nhouse.\\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his\\ngreat, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\\nscratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded\\ndog.\\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”\\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\\nburying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor\\nlittle Harry off ter live with Muggles —”\\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be\\nfound,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as\\nDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He\\nlaid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside\\nHarry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the\\nthree of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,\\nProfessor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually\\nshone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\n“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying\\nhere. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike\\nback. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”\\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the\\nair and off into the night.\\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said\\nDumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\\nstopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of\\nlight sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange\\nand he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of\\nthe street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a\\nswish of his cloak, he was gone.\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy\\nunder the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things tohappen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One\\nsmall hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was\\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few\\nhours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the\\nmilk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\\npinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn’t know that at this very moment,\\npeople meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and\\nsaying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER TWO\\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\\nN early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their\\nnephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun\\nrose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the\\nDursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly\\nthe same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news\\nreport about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed\\nhow much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of\\nwhat looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets —\\nbut Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a\\nlarge blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The\\nroom held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.\\nHis Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise\\nof the day.\\n“Up! Get up! Now!”\\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and\\nthen the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back\\nand tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one.\\nThere had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the\\nsame dream before.\\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\\n“Are you up yet?” she demanded.\\n“Nearly,” said Harry.\\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you\\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”\\nHarry groaned.\\n“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.\\n“Nothing, nothing…”\\nDudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, afterpulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because\\nthe cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though\\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second\\ntelevision and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a\\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course\\nit involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but\\nhe couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of\\nDudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses\\nheld together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\\nwas a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever\\nremember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask\\nquestions.”\\nDon’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nDursleys.\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\\n“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper\\nand shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than\\nthe rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair\\nsimply grew that way — all over the place.\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not\\nmuch neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on\\nhis thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\\n— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as\\nthere wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\\nface fell.\\n“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two\\nless than last year.”“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here\\nunder this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”\\n“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,\\nwho could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\\nas fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\n“And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that,\\npopkin? Two more presents. Is that all right”\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\nslowly, “So I’ll have thirty...thirty...”\\n“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.\\n“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right\\nthen.”\\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\\n“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy,\\nDudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He\\nwas ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from\\nthe telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t\\ntake him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.\\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every\\nyear on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was\\nleft behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry\\nhated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him\\nlook at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.\\n“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\\nhe’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken\\nher leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year\\nbefore he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there\\n— or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand\\nthem, like a slug.\\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.\\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to\\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on\\nDudley’s computer).\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.\\n“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.\\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.\\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “…\\nand leave him in the car.…”\\n“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone.…”\\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had\\nbeen years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face\\nand wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special\\nday!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n“I…don’t…want…him…t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge,\\npretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin\\nthrough the gap in his mother’s arms.\\nJust then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt\\nPetunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss,\\nwalked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He\\nwas usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit\\nthem. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the\\nback of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the\\nfirst time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else\\nto do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up\\nclose to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at\\nall — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”\\n“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…”\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\\nas though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his\\nhair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that\\nhorrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless\\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for hisbaggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to\\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had\\nbeen given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain\\nthat he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\\nold sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to\\npull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have\\nfitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided\\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.\\nOn the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the\\nroof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when,\\nas much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the\\nchimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s\\nheadmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d\\ntried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his\\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry\\nsupposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with\\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his\\ncupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.\\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to\\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and\\nHarry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\\n“…roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a\\nmotorcycle overtook them.\\n“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly.\\n“It was flying.”\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around\\nin his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\\n“MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”\\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”\\nBut he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the\\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about\\nanything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a\\ncartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The\\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and\\nthen, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted beforethey could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t\\nbad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head\\nwho looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.\\nHarry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to\\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were\\nstarting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their\\nfavorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley\\nhad a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on\\ntop, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the\\nfirst.\\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to\\nlast.\\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there,\\nwith lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and\\nsnakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and\\nPiers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.\\nDudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its\\nbody twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at\\nthe moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\nglistening brown coils.\\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\\nglass, but the snake didn’t budge.\\n“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\n“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\\nwouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company\\nexcept stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all\\nday long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only\\nvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got\\nto visit the rest of the house.\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.\\nIt winked.\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\nwatching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:“I get that all the time.”\\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the\\nsnake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”\\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\\n“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.\\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at\\nit.\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n“Was it nice there?”\\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to\\nBrazil?”\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both\\nof them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS\\nSNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\n“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast\\nno one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right\\nup close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had\\nvanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the\\nfloor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the\\nexits.\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing\\nvoice said, “Brazil, here I come.… Thanksss, amigo.”\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”\\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As\\nfar as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at\\ntheir heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car,\\nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was\\nswearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least,\\nwas Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you,\\nHarry?”\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say,\\n“Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, andAunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t\\nknow what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.\\nUntil they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\\nlong as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died\\nin that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had\\ndied. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his\\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a\\nburning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he\\ncouldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his\\nparents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was\\nforbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some\\nunknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that\\nstrangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were,\\ntoo. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping\\nwith Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man,\\nAunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-\\nlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.\\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street\\nthe other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all\\nthese people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\\ncloser look.\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated\\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody\\nliked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER THREE\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever\\npunishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer\\nholidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera,\\ncrashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,\\nknocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s\\ngang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of\\nthe lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in\\nDudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see\\na tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary\\nschool and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had\\nbeen accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was\\ngoing there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local\\npublic school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\\n“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he\\ntold Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”\\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as\\nhorrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley\\ncould work out what he’d said.\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his\\nSmeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as\\nusual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she\\ndidn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and\\ngave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several\\nyears.\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly\\nsticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This wassupposed to be good training for later life.\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears\\nand said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so\\nhandsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of\\nhis ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\\n* * *\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went\\nin for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He\\nwent to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in\\ngray water.\\n“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\\n“Your new school uniform,” she said.\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\\n“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”\\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s\\nold things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his\\nfirst day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin,\\nprobably.\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of\\nthe smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on\\nthe table.\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\\n“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\n“Make Harry get it.”\\n“Get the mail, Harry.”\\n“Make Dudley get it.”\\n“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was\\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and —\\na letter for Harry.\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic\\nband. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no\\nfriends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never evengot rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so\\nplainly there could be no mistake:\\nMr. H. Potter\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\\n4 Privet Drive\\nLittle Whinging\\nSurrey\\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a\\nlarge letter H.\\n“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you\\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle\\nVernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow\\nenvelope.\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\\nthe postcard.\\n“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk.…”\\n“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his\\nhand by Uncle Vernon.\\n“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter\\nopen with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\\nthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the\\ngrayish white of old porridge.\\n“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high\\nout of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a\\nmoment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a\\nchoking noise.\\n“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his\\nfather a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\\n“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”\\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\\ninside its envelope.\\nHarry didn’t move.\\n“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.\\n“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.\\n“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door\\nbehind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who\\nwould listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from\\none ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\\n“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the\\naddress — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think\\nthey’re watching the house?”\\n“Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon\\nwildly.\\n“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we\\ndon’t want —”\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down\\nthe kitchen.\\n“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer…\\nYes, that’s best…we won’t do anything…”\\n“But —”\\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we\\ntook him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something\\nhe’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\n“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\\nthrough the door. “Who’s writing to me?”\\n“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.\\n“I have burned it.”\\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”\\n“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\\nceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which\\nlooked quite painful.\\n“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\\nthinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if youmoved into Dudley’s second bedroom.\\n“Why?” said Harry.\\n“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”\\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where\\nDudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit\\ninto his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he\\nowned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared\\naround him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera\\nwas lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next\\ndoor neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which\\nhe’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there\\nwas a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at\\nschool for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because\\nDudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only\\nthings in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I\\ndon’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given\\nanything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter\\nthan up here without it.\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock.\\nHe’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on\\npurpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof,\\nand he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time\\nyesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon\\nand Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his\\nSmelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one!\\n‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’”\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground\\nto get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had\\ngrabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused\\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon\\nstraightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.\\n“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry.“Dudley — go — just go.”\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had\\nmoved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first\\nletter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they\\ndidn’t fail. He had a plan.\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned\\nit off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole\\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\\nget the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the\\ndark hall toward the front door —\\n“AAAAARRRGH!”\\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on\\nthe doormat — something alive!\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big,\\nsquashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the\\nfoot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do\\nexactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour\\nand then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into\\nthe kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\\nVernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\n“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\npieces before his eyes.\\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed\\nup the mail slot.\\n“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they\\ncan’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”\\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”\\n“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like\\nyou and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\\nfruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go\\nthrough the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the\\nsides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs\\nbathroom.\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and backdoors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he\\nworked, and jumped at small noises.\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry\\nfound their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through\\nthe living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the\\npost office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia\\nshredded the letters in her food processor.\\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in\\namazement.\\n* * *\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\\ntired and rather ill, but happy.\\n“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread\\nmarmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”\\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and\\ncaught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters\\ncame pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry\\nleapt into the air trying to catch one —\\n“Out! OUT!”\\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming\\ninto the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five\\nminutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No\\narguments!”\\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\\nargue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in\\nthe back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he\\ntried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where\\nthey were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\\ndrive in the opposite direction for a while.\\n“Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.\\nThey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five\\ntelevision programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without\\nblowing up an alien on his computer.\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and\\ndamp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the\\nwindowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the\\nnext day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their\\ntable.\\n“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred\\nof these at the front desk.”\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\\nMr. H. Potter\\nRoom 17\\nRailview Hotel\\nCokeworth\\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of\\nthe way. The woman stared.\\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\\nher from the dining room.\\n* * *\\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested\\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he\\nwas looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,\\ngot out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went\\nagain. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across\\na suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late\\nthat afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the\\ncar, and disappeared.\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I\\nwant to stay somewhere with a television.”\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and\\nyou could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because oftelevision — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course,\\nhis birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a\\ncoat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven\\nevery day.\\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\\nthin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.\\n“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no\\ntelevision in there.\\n“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\\nhands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\\nwicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”\\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks\\nand a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they\\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the\\nbroken-down house.\\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and\\nempty. There were only two rooms.\\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and\\nshriveled up.\\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.\\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a\\nchance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed,\\nthough the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.\\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\\nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and\\nmade up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went\\noff to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor\\nhe could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\\ncouldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his\\nstomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rollsof thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which\\nwas dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven\\nin ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if\\nthe Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\\nroof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got\\nback that he’d be able to steal one somehow.\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\\nthat? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the\\nrock crumbling into the sea?\\nOne minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty…ten…\\nnine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three…two…one…\\nBOOM.\\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.\\nSomeone was outside, knocking to come in.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER FOUR\\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\nB OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\\n“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\\nroom. He was holding a rifle in his hands – now they knew what had been in the\\nlong, thin package he had brought with them.\\n“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”\\nThere was a pause. Then —\\nSMASH!\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but\\nyou could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back\\ninto its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look\\nat them all.\\n“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey.\\n…”\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\n“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a\\nlot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”\\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and\\nentering!”\\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached overthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a\\nknot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the\\nroom.\\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a\\nvery happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at\\nsome point, but it’ll taste all right.”\\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed\\nbox. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate\\ncake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\\ngot lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”\\nThe giant chuckled.\\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\\nGrounds at Hogwarts.”\\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.\\n“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d\\nnot say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”\\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he\\nsnorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing\\nbut when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the\\nwhole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him\\nas though he’d sunk into a hot bath.\\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a\\nbottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\\nSoon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a\\nthing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly\\nburnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\\nsharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”\\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’\\nworry.”\\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as\\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t\\nreally know who you are.”\\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of hishand.\\n“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m\\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.\\n“Er — no,” said Harry.\\nHagrid looked shocked.\\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.\\n“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank\\nback into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’\\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer\\ncryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”\\n“All what?” asked Harry.\\n“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”\\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The\\nDursleys were cowering against the wall.\\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy —\\nthis boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all,\\nand his marks weren’t bad.\\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean.\\nYour world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”\\n“What world?”\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed.\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that\\nsounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re\\nfamous. You’re famous.”\\n“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”\\n“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through his\\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy\\nanything!”\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\\nlook Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with\\nrage.\\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledoreleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it\\nfrom him all these years?”\\n“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a\\nwizard.”\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind\\ncould be heard.\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which\\ngroaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve\\nbeen trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be?\\nAn’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\\naddressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The\\nSea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme\\nMugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts\\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary\\nbooks and equipment.\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMinerva McGonagall,\\nDeputy Headmistress\\nQuestions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t\\ndecide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it\\nmean, they await my owl?”\\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to\\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet anotherpocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking\\nowl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth\\nhe scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\\nGiven Harry his letter.\\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\nWeather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.\\nHagrid\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak,\\nwent to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and\\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n“He’s not going,” he said.\\nHagrid grunted.\\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them.\\nAn’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid\\neyes on.”\\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said\\nUncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”\\n“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”\\n“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew!\\nHow could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter\\njust like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every\\nvacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the\\nonly one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and\\nfather, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in\\nthe family!”\\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed\\nshe had been wanting to say all this for years.\\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had\\nyou, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as —\\nabnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we\\ngot landed with you!”Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,\\n“Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”\\n“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys\\nscuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter?\\nIt’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every\\nkid in our world knows his name!”\\n“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea,\\nwhen Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much\\nyeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh —\\nbut someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell\\nyeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It\\nbegins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t\\nknow his name, everyone in our world knows —”\\n“Who?”\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult.\\nSee, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.\\nWorse than worse. His name was...”\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.\\n“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort. ” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’\\nmake me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now,\\nstarted lookin’ fer followers. Got ‘em, too — some were afraid, some just\\nwanted a bit o’ his power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark\\ndays, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange\\nwizards or witches…terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ‘Course, some\\nstood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left\\nwas Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid\\nof. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.\\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew.\\nHead boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-\\nKnow-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before…probably knew they were\\ntoo close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.“Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em...maybe he just wanted ‘em\\noutta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all\\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer\\nhouse an’ — an’ —”\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew\\nhis nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer\\npeople yeh couldn’t find — anyway….\\n“You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of\\nthe thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose,\\nor maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered\\nhow you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what\\nyeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad\\nan’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous,\\nHarry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’\\nhe’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons,\\nthe Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story\\ncame to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than\\nhe had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the\\nfirst time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders.\\nBrought yeh ter this lot….”\\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost\\nforgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have\\ngot back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something\\nstrange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and\\nas for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and\\nthe world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got,\\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always\\nknew they’d come to a sticky end —”\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink\\numbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he\\nsaid, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word….”\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,\\nUncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and\\nfell silent.“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on\\nthe sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”\\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter\\nkill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see…he was\\ngettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?\\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough\\nhuman left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I\\ndon’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em\\ncame outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’\\nback.\\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.\\nToo weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There\\nwas somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was,\\nno one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but\\nHarry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a\\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life\\nbeing clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he\\nwas really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time\\nthey’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest\\nsorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him\\naround like a football?\\n“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t\\nthink I can be a wizard.”\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\nangry?”\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd\\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when\\nhe, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow\\nfound himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous\\nhaircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had\\nhit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?\\nHadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively\\nbeaming at him.\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll beright famous at Hogwarts.”\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall\\nHigh and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of\\nrubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled\\nHagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His\\nname’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of\\nwitchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know\\nhimself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under\\nthe greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”\\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO\\nTEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.\\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it\\nover his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS —\\nDUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”\\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at\\nDudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp\\nsqueal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands\\nclasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them,\\nHarry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other\\nroom, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind\\nthem.\\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work\\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig\\nanyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”\\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said.\\n“I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a\\nbit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so\\nkeen ter take on the job.”\\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.\\n“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell\\nyeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything.\\nBut Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”\\n“Why were you expelled?”\\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly.“Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”\\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think\\nI still got a couple o’ doormice in one o’ the pockets.”HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER FIVE\\nDIAGON ALLEY\\nH arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight,\\nhe kept his eyes shut tight.\\n“It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid\\ncame to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be\\nat home in my cupboard.”\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\nAnd there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart\\nsinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\nTap. Tap. Tap.\\n“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”\\nHe sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa,\\nand there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its\\nbeak.\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon\\nwas swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake\\nup. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.\\n“Don’t do that.”\\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”\\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n“What?”\\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”\\nHagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of\\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry\\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n“Knuts?”\\n“The little bronze ones.”\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg soHarry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\\nthrough the open window.\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all\\nyer stuff fer school.”\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just\\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him\\nhad got a puncture.\\n“Um — Hagrid?”\\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night…he\\nwon’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”\\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\\nhead. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”\\n“But if their house was destroyed —”\\n“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\\nGringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’\\nsay no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”\\n“Wizards have banks?”\\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n“Goblins?”\\n“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess\\nwith goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh\\nwant ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit\\nGringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself\\nup proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you —\\ngettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.”\\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”\\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now\\nand the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still\\nthere, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\\n“Flew,” said Hagrid.\\n“Flew?”\\n“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve\\ngot yeh.”\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\\nimagine him flying.“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\\nhis sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind\\nnot mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\\nthe pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off\\ntoward land.\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\\nspoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh\\ngotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep\\nunder the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did\\nmanage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\\nDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left\\nalone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many\\nquestions in his life.\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning\\nthe page.\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop\\nhimself.\\n“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’\\ncourse, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.\\nBungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,\\naskin’ fer advice.”\\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still\\nwitches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”\\n“Why?”\\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their\\nproblems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to\\nthe station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and\\nsaying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say\\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?”\\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”“You’d like one?”\\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\\nminutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it,\\ngave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\\nsat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night\\nbefore, and read:\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\nUNIFORM\\nFirst-year students will require:\\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\\n4.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\\nloudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell\\nyou a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.\\nCould there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there\\nreally shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some\\nhuge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the\\nDursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\\nthough everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t\\nhelp trusting him.\\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a\\nfamous place.”\\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry\\nwouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it.\\nTheir eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the\\nother as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the\\nmost peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could\\nmention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\\nlong pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\\nquite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\\nat him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”\\n“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his greathand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\\n“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be\\n—?”\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what an\\nhonor.”\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\\nhand, tears in his eyes.\\n“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid\\nwas beaming.\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\\n“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\\n“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus\\nDiggle.”\\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in\\nhis excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\\n“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\\n“Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again —\\nDoris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\\neyes was twitching.\\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one\\nof your teachers at Hogwarts.”\\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-\\ncan’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as\\nthough he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”\\nHe laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve\\ng-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at\\nthe very thought.\\nBut the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\\nmake himself heard over the babble.“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\\nbut a trash can and a few weeds.\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\\nwas tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n“Is he always that nervous?”\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’\\noutta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They\\nsay he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with\\na hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own\\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n“Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”\\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\nThe brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a\\nsmall hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were\\nfacing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\\nstreet that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway.\\nHarry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\\nback into solid wall.\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\\nCauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —\\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money\\nfirst.”\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\\noutside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon\\nliver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\\nOwl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\\nabout Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\\nit. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand —fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\\nstrange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\\nbarrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\\nrolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.…\\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\\nlittle shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\\nscarlet and gold, was —\\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\\nstone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\\na swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\\nfeet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\\nA treasure that was never yours,\\nThief, you have been warned, beware\\nOf finding more than treasure there.\\n“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\\nbehind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\\nexamining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\\ncount leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\\nof these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some\\nmoney outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\\n“You have his key, sir?”\\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\\ngoblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\\ngoblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\\n“That seems to be in order.”“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\\nimportantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault\\nseven hundred and thirteen.”\\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\\n“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone\\ntake you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\\nthe doors leading off the hall.\\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”\\nHarry asked.\\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts\\nbusiness. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\\nmarble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\\nfloor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\\nthem. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\\nto remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\\nThe rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t\\nsteering.\\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\\nwide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\\ntwisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even\\ndeeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\\nfrom the ceiling and floor.\\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s\\nthe difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions\\njust now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\\ndoor in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\\nhis knees from trembling.\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\\nand as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\\nsilver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\\nAll Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have knownabout this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\\nbeen a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to\\na Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should\\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to\\nGriphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\\nslowly?”\\n“One speed only,” said Griphook.\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\\nunderground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\\nat the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\\nneck.\\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\\nwith one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the\\ndoor and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.\\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\\nat the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\\nlittle package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\\nbetter than to ask.\\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way\\nback, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\\nHarry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\\ndidn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\\nwas holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than\\neven Dudley had ever had.\\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\\nMalkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\\noff fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He didstill look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling\\nnervous.\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot\\nhere — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\\nfootstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\\nstood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\\nto pin it to the right length.\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street\\nlooking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m\\ngoing to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t\\nhave their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in\\nsomehow.”\\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n“Play Quidditch at all?”\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house,\\nand I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll\\nbe in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\\nI’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\\ninteresting.\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\\nwindow. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\\nice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.\\n“He works at Hogwarts.”\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\\nevery second.\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school\\ngrounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends upsetting fire to his bed.”\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where\\nare your parents?”\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into\\nthe matter with this boy.\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our\\nkind, weren’t they?”\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just\\nnot the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\\nhave never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\\nshould keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done,\\nmy dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped\\ndown from the footstool.\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.\\nWhen they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”\\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’\\nabout Quidditch!”\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale\\nboy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed\\nin —”\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s\\ngrown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what\\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what\\ndoes he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with\\nmagic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had\\nfer a sister!”\\n“So what is Quidditch?”\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world\\n— everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and\\nthere’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’\\nduffers, but —”\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a\\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who\\nwas one.”\\n“Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”\\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving\\nstones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books\\nfull of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even\\nDudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on\\nsome of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and\\nCountercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the\\nLatest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More)\\nby Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”\\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the\\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway,\\nyeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh\\nget ter that level.”\\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says\\npewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion\\ningredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,\\nwhich was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad\\neggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs,\\ndried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of\\nfangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man\\nbehind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry\\nhimself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and\\nminuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\\n“Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday\\npresent.”\\nHarry felt himself go red.\\n“You don’t have to —”\\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad,toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats,\\nthey make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead\\nuseful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\\ndark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her\\nwing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\\nQuirrell.\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta\\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,\\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\nA magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\\nread Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a\\nfaded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\\ninside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library;\\nhe swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked\\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For\\nsome reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\\njumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\\nspindly chair.\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon.\\nHarry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only\\nyesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter\\ninches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.\\nThose silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven\\ninches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say\\nyour father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\\nnose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.“And that’s where…”\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a\\nlong, white finger.\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-\\nand-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong\\nhands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.\\n…”\\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.…Oak, sixteen\\ninches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”\\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you\\ngot expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got\\nthe pieces, though,” he added brightly.\\n“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well,\\nnow — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver\\nmarkings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”\\n“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.\\n“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to\\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.\\nAs he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful\\nmagical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and\\nthe heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no\\ntwo unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting\\naround the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the\\nfloor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring.\\nNine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.”\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”\\nHarry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, wassnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\\nGo on, go on, try it out.”\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\\nfor. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he\\nseemed to become.\\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here\\nsomewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly\\nand phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”\\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\\nthe wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a\\nstream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing\\ndancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr.\\nOllivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how\\ncurious…how very curious…”\\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\\nstill muttering, “Curious…curious…\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It\\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another\\nfeather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for\\nthis wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\nHarry swallowed.\\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\\nhappen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember…I think we must expect great\\nthings from you, Mr. Potter….After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great\\nthings — terrible, yes, but great.”\\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He\\npaid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\\nshop.\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their\\nway back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky\\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he\\ndidn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground,\\nladen as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl\\nasleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddingtonstation; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the\\nshoulder.\\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.\\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\\nthem. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his\\nlife — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the\\nLeaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander…but I don’t know anything\\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t\\neven remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-,\\nsorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\\nwore a very kind smile.\\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the\\nbeginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard.\\nYeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at\\nHogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, “ he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross\\n— it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with\\nyer owl, she’ll know where to find me….See yeh soon, Harry.”\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he\\nwas out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but\\nhe blinked and Hagrid had gone.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER SIX\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\nH arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so\\nscared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and\\nUncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or\\nshout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half\\nfurious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although\\nthis was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a\\nwhile.\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to\\ncall her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books\\nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig\\nswooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt\\nPetunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back\\ndead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on\\nthe piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the\\nfirst.\\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and\\nuncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the\\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his\\nthroat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the\\nroom.\\n“Er — Uncle Vernon?”\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.”\\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n“Thank you.”\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got\\npunctures, have they?”\\nHarry didn’t say anything.\\n“Where is this school, anyway?”“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the\\nticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven\\no’clock,” he read.\\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\\n“Platform what?”\\n“Nine and three-quarters.”\\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and\\nthree-quarters.”\\n“It’s on my ticket.”\\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see.\\nYou just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to\\nLondon tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”\\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things\\nfriendly.\\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have\\nthat ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”\\nHarry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and\\nnervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t\\nwant to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train.\\nHe checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he\\nneeded, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room,\\nwaiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk\\nhad been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into\\nsitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped\\nHarry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought\\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms\\nwith a nasty grin on his face.\\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform\\nshould be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do\\nthey?”\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the\\nmiddle, nothing at all.\\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\\nleft without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All\\nthree of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth washe going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of\\nHedwig. He’d have to ask someone.\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and\\nthree-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t\\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as\\nthough Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\\nthe train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the\\nend the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten\\nminutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket\\nfull of wizard money, and a large owl.\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he\\nshould get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between\\nplatforms nine and ten.\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\\nfew words of what they were saying.\\n“— packed with Muggles, of course —”\\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to\\nfour boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\\nHarry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\\ndid he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\n“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.\\n“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\\nholding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go…”\\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go\\nfirst.”\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.\\nHarry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy\\nreached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists\\ncame swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared\\naway, the boy had vanished.\\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.\\n“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call\\nyourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”\\n“Sorry, George, dear.”\\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin calledafter him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had\\ngone — but how had he done it?\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\\nalmost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.\\nThere was nothing else for it.\\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.\\n“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”\\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\\ngangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to —”\\n“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\\n“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the\\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll\\ncrash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.\\nGo on, go now before Ron.”\\n“Er — okay,” said Harry.\\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\\nsolid.\\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms\\nnine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that\\nbarrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a\\nheavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to\\nstop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes\\nready for the crash —\\nIt didn’t come…he kept on running…he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam\\nengine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said\\nHogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a\\nwrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine\\nand Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted\\nto one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of\\nheavy trunks.\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\\nout of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\\npushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a\\nround-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”\\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\\nshrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\\ncompartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\\nstarted to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\\nthe steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his\\nfoot.\\n“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through\\nthe barrier.\\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted.\\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”\\nWith the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\\nthe compartment.\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\\n“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s\\nlightning scar.\\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you —?”\\n“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“Harry Potter.” chorused the twins.\\n“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”\\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\\nhis relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.\\n“Fred? George? Are you there?”\\n“Coming, Mom.”\\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch\\nthe red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their\\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\\nbegan rubbing the end of his nose.\\n“Mom — geroff” He wriggled free.\\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the\\ntwins.\\n“Shut up,” said Ron.\\n“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.\\n“He’s coming now.”The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his\\nchest with the letter P on it.\\n“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got\\ntwo compartments to themselves —”\\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great\\nsurprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”\\n“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the\\nother twin. “Once —”\\n“Or twice —”\\n“A minute —”\\n“All summer —”\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.\\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.\\n“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well,\\nhave a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\\n“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more\\nowl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —”\\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”\\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”\\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”\\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”\\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and\\nhis nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\n“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”\\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.\\n“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know\\nwho he is?”\\n“Who?”\\n“Harry Potter!”\\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice.\\n“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....”\\n“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you\\ngoggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”\\n“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”\\n“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so\\npolite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”\\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Wholooks like?”\\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs\\nreminding of that on his first day at school.”\\n“All right, keep your hair on.”\\nA whistle sounded.\\n“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\\ntrain. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their\\nyounger sister began to cry.\\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”\\n“We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.”\\n“George!”\\n“Only joking, Mom.”\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their\\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it\\ngathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\\ncorner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He\\ndidn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was\\nleaving behind.\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\\ncame in.\\n“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.\\n“Everywhere else is full.”\\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and\\nthen looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw\\nhe still had a black mark on his nose.\\n“Hey, Ron.”\\nThe twins were back.\\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a\\ngiant tarantula down there.”\\n“Right,” mumbled Ron.\\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\\nGeorge Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”\\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut\\nbehind them.\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\\nHarry nodded.\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” saidRon. “And have you really got — you know…”\\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who —?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”\\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the\\nwindow again.\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as\\ninteresting as Ron found him.\\n“Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin\\nwho’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.”\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”\\n“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\\nthough. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”\\n“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the\\nsixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to.\\nBill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain\\nof Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but\\nthey still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.\\nEveryone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,\\nbecause they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.\\nI’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.”\\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\\nasleep.\\n“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy\\ngot an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I\\nmean, I got Scabbers instead.”\\nRon’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he\\nwent back to staring out of the window.\\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to\\nafford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago,\\nand he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never\\ngetting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.“…and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a\\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort —”\\nRon gasped.\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked\\nand impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —”\\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I\\njust never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn.…I bet,”\\nhe added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot\\nlately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”\\n“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families\\nand they learn quick enough.”\\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for\\na time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything\\noff the cart, dears?”\\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears\\nwent pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out\\ninto the corridor.\\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that\\nhe had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars\\nBars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did\\nhave were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum,\\nChocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a\\nnumber of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to\\nmiss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver\\nSickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\\nit onto an empty seat.\\n“Hungry, are you?”\\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\\nsandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I\\ndon’t like corned beef..”\\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on —”\\n“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,”\\nhe added quickly, “you know, with five of us.”“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share\\nbefore or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with\\nRon, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the\\nsandwiches lay forgotten).\\n“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate\\nFrogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing\\nwould surprise him.\\n“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”\\n“What?”\\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards,\\ninside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about\\nfive hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”\\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\\nman’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing\\nsilver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus\\nDumbledore.\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have\\na frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for\\nthe discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy\\nwith his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music\\nand tenpin bowling.\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\\nDumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n“He’s gone!”\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be\\nback. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it?\\nYou can start collecting.”\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\\nunwrapped.\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,people just stay put in photos.”\\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed.\\n“Weird!”\\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\\ngave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking\\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off\\nthem. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\\nWoodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\\neyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a\\nbag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.\\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say\\nevery flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones\\nlike chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\\nliver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\\n“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”\\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\\ncoconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even\\nbrave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which\\nturned out to be pepper.\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The\\nneat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green\\nhills.\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\\ntearful.\\n“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting\\naway from me!”\\n“He’ll turn up,” said Harry.\\n“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”\\nHe left.\\n“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d\\nlose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.\\n“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in\\ndisgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\\nthe spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look…”\\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-lookingwand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\\n“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —”\\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.\\nThe toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already\\nwearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy\\nsort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\\n“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl\\nwasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\n“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”\\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n“Er — all right.”\\nHe cleared his throat.\\n“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”\\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\\nasleep.\\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good,\\nis it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.\\nNobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\\nletter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of\\nwitchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of\\ncourse, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who\\nare you?”\\nShe said all this very fast.\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\\nhadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.\\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I\\ngot a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical\\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\\nthe Twentieth Century.”\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it\\nwas me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve\\nbeen asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; Ihear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too\\nbad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better\\nchange, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his\\nwand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it\\nwas a dud.”\\n“What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\\n“Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t\\nsuppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”\\n“That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said\\nHarry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do\\nnow that they’ve left, anyway?”\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school.\\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing\\nsomething for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all\\nover the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles —\\nsomeone tried to rob a high security vault.”\\nHarry stared.\\n“Really? What happened to them?”\\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My\\ndad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they\\ndon’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared\\nwhen something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”\\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\\nof fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\\npart of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\\n“Voldemort” without worrying.\\n“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\\n“Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in\\nthe world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\\npositions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his\\nbrothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just\\ntaking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\\nslid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Grangerthis time.\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\\nlot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry\\nPotter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\\nthickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\\nlooked like bodyguards.\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly,\\nnoticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\\nMalfoy looked at him.\\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\\nfather told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\\nthey can afford.”\\nHe turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families\\nare much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the\\nwrong sort. I can help you there.”\\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.\\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said\\ncoolly.\\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit\\npoliter you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good\\nfor them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\\nand it’ll rub off on you.”\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\\n“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.\\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\\n“But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food\\nand you still seem to have some.”\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt\\nforward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep\\ninto Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\\nScabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hitthe window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\\nwere more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps,\\nbecause a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\n“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the\\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\\n“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\\nScabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.”\\nAnd so he had.\\n“You’ve met Malfoy before?”\\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\\n“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first\\nto come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been\\nbewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an\\nexcuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you\\nwith something?”\\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the\\nfront to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been\\nfighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!”\\n“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would\\nyou mind leaving while we change?”\\n“All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving\\nvery childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy\\nvoice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\\ngetting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The\\ntrain did seem to be slowing down.\\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\\nRon’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\\nA voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\\nminutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the\\nschool separately.”\\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\\nhis freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\\nthe crowd thronging the corridor.\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\\nway toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\\ncold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\\nHarry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,\\nHarry?”Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\\n“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’\\nyears follow me!”\\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\\nsteep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there\\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing\\nhis toad, sniffed once or twice.\\n“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his\\nshoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”\\nThere was a loud “Oooooh!”\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black\\nlake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in\\nthe starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\\n“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\\nboats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their\\nboat by Neville and Hermione.\\n“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then\\n— FORWARD!”\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake,\\nwhich was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle\\noverhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on\\nwhich it stood.\\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all\\nbent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid\\na wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which\\nseemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind\\nof underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the\\nboats as people climbed out of them.\\n“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last\\nonto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak\\nfront door.\\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”\\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER SEVEN\\nTHE SORTING HAT\\nT he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green\\nrobes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that\\nthis was not someone to cross.\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.\\n“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit\\nthe whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a\\nmagnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.\\nHarry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right —\\nthe rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed\\nthe first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,\\nstanding rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about\\nnervously.\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term\\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you\\nwill be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony\\nbecause, while you are here, your house will be something like your family\\nwithin Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your\\nhouse dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\\n“The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\\noutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will\\nearn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end\\nof the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great\\nhonor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can\\nwhile you are waiting.”\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened\\nunder his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flattenhis hair.\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“Please wait quietly.”\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\njoking.”\\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school?\\nBut he didn’t know any magic yet —what on earth would he have to do? He\\nhadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around\\nanxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the\\nspells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not\\nto listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to\\ntake a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his\\nteacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now,\\nProfessor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air —\\nseveral people behind him screamed.\\n“What the —?”\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they\\nglided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first\\nyears. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying:\\n“Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”\\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\\ngives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what\\nare you all doing here?”\\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\\nNobody answered.\\n“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be\\nSorted, I suppose?”\\nA few people nodded mutely.\\n“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old house, you\\nknow.”\\n“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about\\nto start.”\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\\nthrough the opposite wall.“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and\\nfollow me.”\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the\\nchamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great\\nHall.\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four\\nlong tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid\\nwith glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years\\nup here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the\\nteachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale\\nlanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students,\\nthe ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked\\nupward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione\\nwhisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts,\\nA History.”\\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great\\nHall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently\\nplaced a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a\\npointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt\\nPetunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\\nthat seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now\\nstaring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete\\nsilence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth —\\nand the hat began to sing:\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\\nBut don’t judge on what you see,\\nI’ll eat myself if you can find\\nA smarter hat than me.\\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\\nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\nAnd I can cap them all.\\nThere’s nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can’t see,\\nSo try me on and I will tell you\\nWhere you ought to be.\\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\\nSet Gryffindors apart;\\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\\nWhere they are just and loyal,\\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\\nAnd unafraid of toil;\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\nif you’ve a ready mind,\\nWhere those of wit and learning,\\nWill always find their kind;\\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\\nYou’ll make your real friends,\\nThose cunning folk use any means\\nTo achieve their ends.\\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid!\\nAnd don’t get in a flap!\\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none)\\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap!”\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to\\neach of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill\\nFred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having\\nto do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone\\nwatching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or\\nquick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house\\nfor people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\\nparchment.\\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be\\nsorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the\\nhat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause —“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\\nthe Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\\n“Bones, Susan!”\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit\\nnext to Hannah.\\n“Boot, Terry!”\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender”\\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with\\ncheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s\\nimagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like\\nan unpleasant lot.\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked\\nfor teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,\\nnot because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they\\nliked him.\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\\nothers it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy\\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the\\nhat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n“Granger, Hermione!”\\nHer mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her\\nhead.\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when\\nyou’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there\\nwith the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his\\nhead and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the\\ntrain?\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,\\nhe fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with\\nNeville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing\\nit, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\\nonce: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with\\nhimself.\\nThere weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…,\\n“Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks,\\nSally-Anne”…, and then, at last —\\n“Potter, Harry!”\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing\\nfires all over the hall.\\n“Potter, did she say?”\\n“The Harry Potter?”\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking\\nat the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of\\ncourage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and\\na nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting….So where shall I put\\nyou?”\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not\\nSlytherin.\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be\\ngreat, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the\\nway to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be\\nGRYFFINDOR!”\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the\\nhat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have\\nbeen chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the\\nloudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while\\nthe Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down\\nopposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving\\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold\\nwater.\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\\nHagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.\\nAnd there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus\\nDumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the\\nChocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the\\nwhole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very\\npeculiar in a large purple turban.\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,”\\na Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin,\\nLisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by\\nnow. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had\\nshouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to\\nhim.\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry\\nas “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her\\nscroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized\\nhow hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the\\nstudents, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than\\nto see them all there.\\n“Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we\\nbegin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n“Thank you!”\\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know\\nwhether to laugh or not.\\n“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But\\nhe is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with\\nfood. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef,\\nroast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled\\npotatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup,\\nand, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been\\nallowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry\\nreally wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of\\neverything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry\\ncut up his steak.\\n“Can’t you —?”\\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’tneed to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir\\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor\\nTower.”\\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about\\nyou — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”\\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost\\nbegan stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going\\nat all the way he wanted.\\n“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole\\nhead swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.\\nSomeone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking\\npleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his\\nhead back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope\\nyou’re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have\\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a\\nrow! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin\\nghost.”\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting\\nthere, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.\\nHe was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too\\npleased with the seating arrangements.\\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.\\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food\\nfaded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later\\nthe desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of,\\napple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries,\\nJell-O, rice pudding…\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell\\nhim she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”\\nThe others laughed.\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.\\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the\\nfamily thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to\\ncatch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the\\nend of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until Iwas eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out\\nof an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a\\nmeringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the\\ngarden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was\\nso happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they\\nthought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was\\nso pleased he bought me my toad.”\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\\nlessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m\\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into\\nsomething else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be\\nstarting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High\\nTable again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall\\nwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban,\\nwas talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past\\nQuirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across\\nthe scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n“N-nothing.”\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the\\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like\\nHarry at all.\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so\\nnervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —\\neveryone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark\\nArts, Snape.”\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to\\nhis feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I\\nhave a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all\\npupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\\ntwins.“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that\\nno magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone\\ninterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the\\nright-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very\\npainful death.”\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he\\nusually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s\\nfull of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us\\nprefects, at least.”\\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried\\nDumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather\\nfixed.\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly\\noff the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the\\ntables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”\\nAnd the school bellowed:\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\nTeach us something please,\\nWhether we be old and bald\\nOr young with scabby knees,\\nOur heads could do with filling\\nWith some interesting stuff,\\nFor now they’re bare and full of air,\\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\\nBring back what we’ve forgot,\\njust do your best, we’ll do the rest,\\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.”\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley\\ntwins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore\\nconducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was\\none of those who clapped loudest.\\n“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here!And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,\\nout of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead\\nagain, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even\\nto be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and\\npointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden\\nbehind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases,\\nyawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much\\nfarther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as\\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised\\nhis voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide\\nmouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”\\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked\\nPercy.\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on\\nNeville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he\\npassed.\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again.\\n“The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to\\nus prefects. Here we are.”\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\\npink silk dress.\\n“Password?” she said.\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a\\nround hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up\\n— and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room\\nfull of squashy armchairs.\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys\\nthrough another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of\\nthe towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red,\\nvelvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk\\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get\\noff, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell\\nasleep almost at once.\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange\\ndream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him,\\ntelling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.\\nHarry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and\\nheavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy,\\nlaughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-\\nnosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of\\ngreen light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he\\ndidn’t remember the dream at all.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER EIGHT\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\nT here, look.”\\n“Where?”\\n“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”\\n“Wearing the glasses?”\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next\\nday. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or\\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they\\nwouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a\\nFriday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to\\njump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or\\ntickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all,\\nbut solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where\\nanything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the\\nportraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor\\ncould walk.\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of\\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless\\nNick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but\\nPeeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you\\nmet him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on\\nyour head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak\\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus\\nFilch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first\\nmorning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that\\nunluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third\\nfloor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into\\nit on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they wererescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature\\nwith bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone.\\nBreak a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for\\nFilch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret\\npassageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley\\ntwins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated\\nhim, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than\\nwaving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements\\nof the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the\\ncastle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,\\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and\\nfound out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of\\nMagic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very\\nold indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up\\nnext morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on\\nwhile they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric\\nthe Oddball mixed up.\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had\\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he\\ntook the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak\\nand toppled out of sight.\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to\\nthink she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to\\nthe moment they sat down in her first class.\\n“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\\nwill learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will\\nleave and not come back. You have been warned.”\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very\\nimpressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going\\nto be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of\\ncomplicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into\\na needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any\\ndifference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone\\nall silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His\\nclassroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a\\nvampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him\\none of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African\\nprince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t\\nsure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked\\neagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and\\nstarted talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell\\nhung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of\\ngarlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone\\nelse. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had\\nany idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that\\neven people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\\nporridge.\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of\\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s\\ntrue.”\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was\\nhead of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile\\nof homework the day before.\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it\\nhad given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls\\nhad suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables\\nuntil they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to\\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with\\nthe other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the\\nmarmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore\\nit open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\nDear Harry,\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a\\ncup of tea with me around three?\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back withHedwig.\\nHagrid\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back\\nof the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so\\nfar.\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\\nSnape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been\\nwrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\\nhere than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough\\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like\\nFlitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n“Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\\nhands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes\\nwere black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold\\nand empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,”\\nhe began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\\n— like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent\\nwithout effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will\\nhardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty\\nof the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power\\nof liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the\\nsenses.…I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death —\\nif you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\\nwith raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked\\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.\\n“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered\\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron,\\nwho looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air.\\n“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.\\nSnape’s lips curled into a sneer.“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\nbezoar?”\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\\nher leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.\\nHe tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with\\nlaughter.\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry\\nforced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked\\nthrough his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember\\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\nceiling.\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why\\ndon’t you try her?”\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.\\nSnape, however, was not pleased.\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter,\\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the\\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat\\nand it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they\\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t\\nyou all copying that down?”\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,\\nSnape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,\\nPotter.”\\nThings didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\\ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple\\npotion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them\\nweigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except\\nMalfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the\\nperfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green\\nsmoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to\\nmelt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across\\nthe stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole classwas standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion\\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all\\nover his arms and legs.\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\\nwave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the\\ncauldron off the fire?”\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\\nhe’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point\\nyou’ve lost for Gryffindor.”\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\\nhim behind their cauldron.\\n“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind\\nwas racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his\\nvery first week — why did Snape hate him so much?\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and\\nGeorge. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\\ngrounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden\\nforest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\\nseveral booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang —\\nback.”\\nHagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\\n“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\\nblack boarhound.\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from\\nthe ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a\\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded\\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as\\nfierce as he looked.\\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I spenthalf me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\\nteeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all\\nabout their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all\\nover his robes.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang\\nsometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me\\neverywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not\\nto worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes\\nwhen he said that.\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot —\\ngreat with animals.”\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While\\nRon told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece\\nof paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the\\nDaily Prophet:\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely\\nbelieved to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that\\nwas searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you\\nknow what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob\\nGringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!\\nIt might’ve been happening while we were there!”\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes\\nthis time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story\\nagain. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same\\nday. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it\\nemptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieveswere looking for?\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\\nweighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought\\nthat none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as\\ntea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it\\nnow? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell\\nHarry?HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER NINE\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\nH arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,\\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had\\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or\\nat least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on\\nThursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool\\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron\\nreasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at\\nQuidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about\\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful\\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in\\nhelicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it,\\nhe’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his\\nbroomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d\\nalmost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding\\nfamilies talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument\\nwith Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see\\nwhat was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to\\nfly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team,\\ntrying to make the players move.\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good\\nreason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents\\neven with both feet on the ground.\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.\\nThis was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she\\nhadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips\\nshe’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Nevillewas hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him\\nhang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when\\nHermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\nHarry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that\\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always\\nbringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the\\nSlytherin table.\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He\\nopened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble,\\nwhich seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things — this\\ntells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like\\nthis and if it turns red — oh…” His face fell, because the Remembrall had\\nsuddenly glowed scarlet, “…you’ve forgotten something….”\\nNeville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy,\\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason\\nto fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than\\nany teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n“What’s going on?”\\n“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\n“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle\\nbehind him.\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried\\ndown the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,\\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the\\nsloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to\\nthe forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain\\nabout the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew\\ntoo high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\\n“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a\\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.”\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuckout at odd angles.\\n“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the\\nfront, “and say ‘Up!’”\\n“UP” everyone shouted.\\nHarry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\\nthat did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and\\nNeville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you\\nwere afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only\\ntoo clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without\\nsliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong\\nfor years.\\n“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said\\nMadam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come\\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two\\n—”\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.\\n“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\\ncork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared\\nwhite face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways\\noff the broom and —\\nWHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the\\ngrass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to\\ndrift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right,\\nup you get.”\\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\\n“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\\nleave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can\\nsay ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\\nMadam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n“Did you see his face, the great lump?”\\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced\\nSlytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”\\n“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\\ngrass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to\\nwatch.\\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\\n“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about —\\nup a tree?”\\n“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\\nand taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the\\ntopmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”\\nHarry grabbed his broom.\\n“No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move\\n— you’ll get us all into trouble.”\\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the\\nbroom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed\\nthrough his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce\\njoy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this\\nwas easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even\\nhigher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring\\nwhoop from Ron.\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy\\nlooked stunned.\\n“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”\\n“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the\\nbroom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy\\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the\\nbroom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\n“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high\\ninto the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then\\nstart to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next\\nsecond he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled\\nin his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out hishand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom\\nstraight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched\\nsafely in his fist.\\n“HARRY POTTER!”\\nHis heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was\\nrunning toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —”\\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses\\nflashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your neck —”\\n“It wasn’t his fault, Professor —”\\n“Be quiet, Miss Patil —”\\n“But Malfoy —”\\n“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as\\nhe left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward\\nthe castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say\\nsomething to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his\\nvoice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him;\\nhe had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks.\\nHe’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he\\nturned up on the doorstep?\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\\nMcGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched\\nalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking\\nhim to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\\ngamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he\\nimagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped\\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\\nand poked her head inside.\\n“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?”\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to\\nuse on him?\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\\nof Flitwick’s class looking confused.\\n“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on\\nup the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\n“In here.”\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was emptyexcept for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\\nclanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the\\ndoor behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”\\nWood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n“Are you serious, Professor?”\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural.\\nI’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,\\nPotter?”\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he\\ndidn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to\\nhis legs.\\n“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor\\nMcGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t\\nhave done it.”\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\n“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall\\nexplained.\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around\\nHarry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent\\nbroom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-\\nyear rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that\\nlast match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.…”\\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\\nabout punishing you.”\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent\\nQuidditch player himself.”\\n“You’re joking.”\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\\nwhen he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak\\nand kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.\\n“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest\\nhouse player in about —”“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt\\nparticularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood\\nwants to keep it a secret.”\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and\\nhurried over.\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the\\nteam too — Beaters.”\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said\\nFred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be\\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret\\npassageway out of the school.”\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\\nin our first week. See you.”\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\\nturned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\\nMuggles?”\\n“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got\\nyour little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at\\nall little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,\\nneither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you\\nwant. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard\\nof a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s\\nyours?”\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy\\nroom; that’s always unlocked.”\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re\\nmy second?”\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting\\nstarted at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added\\nquickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The\\nmost you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of youknows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse,\\nanyway.”\\n“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\\n“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.\\n“Excuse me.”\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\\n“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of\\nthe points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s\\nreally very selfish of you.”\\n“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\\n“Good-bye,” said Ron.\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry\\nthought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep\\n(Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving\\nhim advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I\\ncan’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were\\ngoing to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his\\nluck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering\\nface kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat\\nMalfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.\\n“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\\nthe tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs\\ninto hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a\\nvoice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this,\\nHarry.”\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\\nand a frown.\\n“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”\\n“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect,\\nhe’d put a stop to this.”\\nHarry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Ladyand climbed through the hole.\\nHermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\\nthe portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\n“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I\\ndon’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got\\nfrom Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.”\\n“Go away.”\\n“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re\\non the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”\\nBut what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the\\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty\\npainting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked\\nout of Gryffindor tower.\\n“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.\\n“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be\\nlate.”\\nThey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught\\nup with them.\\n“I’m coming with you,” she said.\\n“You are not.”\\n“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?\\nIf he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and\\nyou can back me up.”\\n“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.\\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.”\\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast\\nasleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t\\nremember the new password to get in to bed.”\\n“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t\\nhelp you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”\\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry.\\n“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in\\nabout a minute.”\\n“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you\\nlater —”\\n“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want tostay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\\nNeville.\\n“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse\\nof the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\\nCurse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all\\nforward.\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high\\nwindows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they\\nwere lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the\\ntrophy room.\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases\\nglimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues\\nwinked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping\\ntheir eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case\\nMalfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\\n“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just\\nraised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.\\n“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently\\ntoward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped\\nround the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\\n“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.”\\n“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\\nnearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he\\ntripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a\\nsuit of armor.\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\n“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the\\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without\\nany idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a\\ntapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came\\nout near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy\\nroom.“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and\\nwiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\nI — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\\n“I — told — you.”\\n“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly as\\npossible.”\\n“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t\\nyou? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in\\nthe trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.\\n“Let’s go.”\\nIt wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen\\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom\\nin front of them.\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\n“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”\\nPeeves cackled.\\n“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,\\nnaughty, you’ll get caughty.”\\n“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”\\n“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes\\nglittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”\\n“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\\nbig mistake.\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF\\nBED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\\ncorridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.\\n“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re\\ndone for! This is the end!”\\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward\\nPeeves’s shouts.\\n“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped\\nthe lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut\\nit quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”\\n“Say ‘please.’”\\n“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying\\nsingsong voice.\\n“All right — please.”\\n“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say\\nplease! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away\\nand Filch cursing in rage.\\n“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay\\n— get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s\\nbathrobe for the last minute. “What?”\\nHarry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\\nwas sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of\\neverything that had happened so far.\\nThey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor.\\nThe forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\\nforbidden.\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs\\nof rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three\\ndrooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew\\nthat the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance\\nhad taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no\\nmistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take\\nFilch.\\nThey fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\\nalmost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for\\nthem somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly\\ncared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them\\nand that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the\\nFat Lady on the seventh floor.\\n“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their\\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait\\nswung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed,\\ntrembling, into armchairs.\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\\nas if he’d never speak again.\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up ina school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You\\ndon’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it\\nwas standing on.\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too\\nbusy with its heads.”\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding\\nsomething.”\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed —\\nor worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\n“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,\\nwouldn’t you.\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he\\nclimbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something…What had Hagrid\\nsaid? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\\nhide — except perhaps Hogwarts.\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package\\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER TEN\\nHALLOWEEN\\nM alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still\\nat Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had\\nbeen an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In\\nthe meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been\\nmoved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\\ncould possibly need such heavy protection.\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was\\nabout two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was\\nwithout further clues.\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going\\nnear the dog again.\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such\\na bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a\\nthing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention\\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\\nHarry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,\\nand was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when\\nanother owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want\\neverybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver\\nWood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first\\ntraining session.Professor McGonagall\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even\\ntouched one.”\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\\nbefore their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way\\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and\\nfelt it.\\n“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\\nof jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years\\naren’t allowed them.”\\nRon couldn’t resist it.\\n“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nWhat did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron\\ngrinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the\\nNimbus.”\\n“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the\\nhandle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up\\ntwig by twig.”\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s\\nelbow.\\n“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\\n“Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.\\n“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\\n“Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And\\nwhat model is it?”\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\\nlook of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve\\ngot it,” he added.\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s\\nobvious rage and confusion.\\n“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble\\nstaircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.\\n…”\\n“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an\\nangry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\\nlooking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\\nhis bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that\\nnight. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\\nand then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\\ntoward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\\nof seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\\nenough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\\nMuggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\\nand kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the\\ngoal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\\nturned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n“Hey, Potter, come down!”\\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\\narm. Harry landed next to him.\\n“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall\\nmeant…you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this\\nevening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\\nif it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\\nare called Chasers.”\\n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\\n“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the\\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\\nTen points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”\\n“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,”\\nHarry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with sixhoops, isn’t it?”\\n“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\\n“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m\\nKeeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\\nfrom scoring.”\\n“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to\\nremember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\\nthey for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two\\nare the Bludgers.”\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\\nstraps holding them inside the box.\\n“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\\nBludgers.\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\\nHarry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\\nsent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then\\nshot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\\n“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\\nand strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\\nplayers off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the\\nWeasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\\nand try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”\\n“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled\\noff.\\n“Very good,” said Wood.\\n“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he\\nsounded offhand.\\n“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\\nworse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And\\nyou don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”\\n“— unless they crack my head open.”\\n“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I\\nmean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\\nlarge walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\\n“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball\\nof the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the\\nSeeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\\nBludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because\\nwhichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\\npoints, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A\\ngame of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\\n— I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\\nthe players could get some sleep.\\n“Well, that’s it any questions?”\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\\n“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it\\nback inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few\\nof these.”\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\\nhard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\\nhour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.\\n“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood\\nhappily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn\\nout better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\\nhadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\\nbelieve it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The\\ncastle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were\\nbecoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\\npumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick\\nannounced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\\nsomething they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s\\ntoad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to\\npractice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, becauseNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\\nHermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier\\nabout this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick\\nhad arrived.\\n“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!”\\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.\\n“Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words\\nproperly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’\\ninstead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.\\nSeamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it —\\nHarry had to put it out with his hat.\\nRon, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.\\n“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a\\nwindmill.\\n“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-\\ndium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”\\n“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\\n“Wingardium Leviosa!”\\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\\nheads.\\n“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here,\\nMiss Granger’s done it!”\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed\\ntheir way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\\nHarry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in\\ntears.\\n“I think she heard you.”\\n“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed\\nshe’s got no friends.”\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon.\\nOn their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron\\noverheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in\\nthe girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward\\nat this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloweendecorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand\\nmore swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\\npumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at\\nthe start-of-term banquet.\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\\ncame sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\\nstared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table,\\nand gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\\nthe end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.\\n“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories\\nimmediately!”\\nPercy was in his element.\\n“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you\\nfollow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming\\nthrough! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”\\n“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe\\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\\nAs they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\\nsuddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.\\n“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”\\n“What about her?”\\n“She doesn’t know about the troll.”\\nRon bit his lip.\\n“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\\ndown a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They\\nhad just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\\n“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\\ncorridor and disappeared from view.\\n“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the\\ndungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\\n“Search me.”\\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’sfading footsteps.\\n“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\\n“Can you smell something?”\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\nAnd then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\\ngigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\\nwas moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\\nemerged into a patch of moonlight.\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\\nits great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\\ncoconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\\ncoming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\\nears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\n“The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”\\n“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t\\nabout to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\\nslam the door, and lock it.\\n“Yes!”\\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as\\nthey reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a\\nhigh, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just\\nchained up.\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\\n“Hermione!” they said together.\\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\\nWheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\\ntheir panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\\nshe was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\\nwalls as it went.\\n“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw\\nit as hard as he could against the wall.\\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\\nstupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. Ithesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\\n“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\\nthrew a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward\\nRon instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\\n“Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\\nthe door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth\\nopen with terror.\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\\nroared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck\\nfrom behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will\\nnotice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been\\nin his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.\\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\\nclinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch\\nhim a terrible blow with the club.\\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\\n— not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that\\ncame into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!”\\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the\\nair, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s\\nhead. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that\\nmade the whole room tremble.\\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\\nstanding there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\\n“Is it — dead?”\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.”\\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered\\nin what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\n“Urgh — troll boogers.”\\nHe wiped it on the troll’s trousers.\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\\nThey hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,\\nsomeone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment\\nlater, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed\\nby Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\\nHarry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of\\nwinning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.\\n“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with\\ncold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his\\nwand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your\\ndormitory?”\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\\nwished Ron would put his wand down.\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”\\n“Miss Granger!”\\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on\\nmy own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\\nteacher?\\n“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its\\nnose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come\\nand fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”\\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.\\n“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three\\nof them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a\\nmountain troll on your own?”\\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\\nperson to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\\nget them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\\n“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all,\\nyou’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their\\nhouses.”\\nHermione left.\\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\n“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\\ntaken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points.\\nProfessor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”\\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had\\nclimbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quiteapart from anything else.\\n“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.\\n“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”\\n“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind\\nyou, we did save her.”\\n“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with\\nher,” Harry reminded him.\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n“Pig snout,” they said and entered.\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food\\nthat had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for\\nthem. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each\\nother, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There\\nare some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and\\nknocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER ELEVEN\\nQUIDDITCH\\nA s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains\\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning\\nthe ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows\\ndefrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin\\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing\\nin his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If\\nGryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house\\nchampionship.\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was\\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which was\\nworse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be\\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress.\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t\\nknow how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all\\nthe last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent\\nhim Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in\\n1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most\\nserious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people\\nrarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up\\nmonths later in the Sahara Desert.\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since\\nHarry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\\nfor it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in\\nthe freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue\\nfire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their\\nbacks to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once\\nthat Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to\\nblock the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately,something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He\\nhadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\\nanyway.\\n“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”\\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape. “Give\\nit to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”\\n“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\\naway. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?”\\n“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.\\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\\nRon’s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (“How will\\nyou learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers\\nanyway.\\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take\\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape?\\nGetting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could\\nhave it.\\n“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea that\\nSnape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no\\nanswer. He knocked again. Nothing.\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed\\nthe door ajar and peered inside – and a horrible scene met his eyes.\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above\\nhis knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\\nbandages.\\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to keep your\\neyes on all three heads at once?”\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but —\\n“POTTER!”\\nSnape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\\nhide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”\\n“GET OUT! OUT!”\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He\\nsprinted back upstairs.“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the matter?”\\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.\\n“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to get\\npast that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we\\nsaw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick he let\\nthat troll in, to make a diversion!”\\nHermione’s eyes were wide.\\n“No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he\\nwouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,”\\nsnapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s\\nhe after? What’s that dog guarding?”\\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville\\nwas snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he\\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours – but\\nthe expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to\\nforget.\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of\\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking\\nforward to a good Quidditch match.\\n“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”\\n“I don’t want anything.”\\n“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.\\n“I’m not hungry.”\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.\\n“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are\\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”\\n“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\\nsausages.\\nBy eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\\nthe Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised\\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan\\nup in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one\\nof the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who\\nwas good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then\\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed differentcolors.\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in\\ngreen).\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n“Okay, men,” he said.\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the\\nteam last year.”\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had\\nin years. We’re going to win. I know it.”\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his\\nknees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field\\nwaiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all\\ngathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to\\nthe Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if\\nhe had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering\\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart\\nskipped. He felt braver.\\n“Mount your brooms, please.”\\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\\n“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of\\nGryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too —”\\n“JORDAN!”\\n“Sorry, Professor.”\\nThe Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for\\nthe match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\n“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a\\ngood find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and —\\nno, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gainsthe Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to\\nsc— no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the\\nGryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice\\ndive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in\\nthe back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s\\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a second\\nBludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice\\nplay by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the\\nQuaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a\\nspeeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina —\\nKeeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the\\nSlytherins.\\n“Budge up there, move along.”\\n“Hagrid!”\\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to\\njoin them.\\n“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of\\nbinoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign\\nof the Snitch yet, eh?”\\n“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”\\n“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his\\nbinoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about\\nfor some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s game plan.\\n“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had said.\\n“We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”\\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to\\nlet off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he\\ncaught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the\\nWeasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way,\\nmore like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley\\ncame chasing after it.\\n“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\\n“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks\\ntwo Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a\\nmoment — was that the Snitch?”\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left\\near.\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck\\nthey hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what\\nthey were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\\nHarry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings\\nfluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed —\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus\\nFlint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry\\nholding on for dear life.\\n“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.\\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch\\nhad disappeared from sight again.\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red\\ncard!”\\n“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.\\n“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the red card\\nand you’re out of the game!”\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.”\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul…”\\n“Jordan, I’m warning you —”\\n“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could\\nhappen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who\\nputs it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning\\ndangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden,\\nfrightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped\\nthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt anything like\\nthat.\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\\noff. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.\\nHarry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he had half a mindto ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was\\ncompletely out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it at all. It\\nwas zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing\\nmovements that almost unseated him.\\nLee was still commentating.\\n“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet —\\npasses Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only\\njoking, Professor — Slytherins score — A no…”\\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that\\nHarry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away\\nfrom the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\n“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared\\nthrough his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his\\nbroom…but he can’t have.…”\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.\\nThen the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry\\nswung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\\n“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus\\nwhispered.\\n“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing interfere\\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a\\nNimbus Two Thousand.”\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of\\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\n“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands\\nopposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under\\nhis breath.\\n“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.\\n“What should we do?”\\n“Leave it to me.”\\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron\\nturned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was\\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its\\nfeet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely\\nonto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the\\nbroom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and\\nscored five times without anyone noticing.\\n“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.\\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and\\nwas now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as\\nshe knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape,\\nshe crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen\\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes.\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A\\nsudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little\\njar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know\\nwhat had happened.\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\\nto his broom.\\n“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\\nHagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all\\nfours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.\\n“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game\\nended in complete confusion.\\n“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling\\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules\\nand Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by\\none hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and\\nHermione.\\n“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He was\\ncursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on\\nnext to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\\nhim. Harry decided on the truth.\\n“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past\\nthat three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal\\nwhatever it’s guarding.”\\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\\n“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.\\n“Fluffy?”“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub\\nlas’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”\\n“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.\\n“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top secret,\\nthat is.”\\n“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do\\nnothin’ of the sort.”\\n“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.\\nThe afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\\nSnape.\\n“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve\\ngot to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”\\n“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ know why\\nHarry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now,\\nlisten to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s\\ndangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between\\nProfessor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel —”\\n“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,\\nis there?”\\nHagrid looked furious with himself.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER TWELVE\\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\\nC hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to\\nfind itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley\\ntwins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed\\nQuirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed\\nto battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back\\nto health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor\\ncommon room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had\\nbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all\\nwere Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in\\na mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those\\npeople who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted\\nat home.”\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.\\nHarry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy\\nhad been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted\\nthat the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-\\nmouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized\\nthat nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way\\nHarry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and\\nangry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\nIt was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.\\nProfessor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of\\nstudents who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at\\nonce. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best\\nChristmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir\\ntree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom\\nand a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\n“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through thebranches.\\n“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”\\n“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl\\nfrom behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping\\nto be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of\\nHagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n“WEASLEY!”\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.\\n“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge\\nhairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”\\n“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said\\nSnape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t\\nmore. Move along, all of you.”\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering\\nneedles everywhere and smirking.\\n“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of\\nthese days, I’ll get him —”\\n“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”\\n“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh what,\\ncome with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall,\\nwhere Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the\\nChristmas decorations.\\n“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all\\naround the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around\\nthe room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of\\ncandles.\\n“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.\\n“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve\\ngot half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”\\n“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor\\nFlitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing\\nthem over the branches of the new tree.\\n“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just before\\nthe holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you\\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh —\\ndrop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”\\n“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.\\n“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added. “We\\nmust’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him\\nanywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.\\n“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid\\nlooking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since\\nHagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\\nwas trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin,\\nnot knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t\\nin Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our\\nTime; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A\\nStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the\\nsheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves;\\nhundreds of narrow rows.\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search\\nwhile Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the\\nshelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been\\nwondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the\\nrestricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the books\\ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by\\nolder students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n“What are you looking for, boy?”\\n“Nothing,” said Harry.\\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\\n“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”\\nWishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the\\nlibrary. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam\\nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them,\\nbut they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\\nanything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks,\\nafter A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising\\nthey’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without\\nMadam Pince breathing down their necks.Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\\nThey went off to lunch.\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione.\\n“And send me an owl if you find anything.”\\n“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron.\\n“It’d be safe to ask them.”\\n“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to\\nthink much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good\\narmchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\\ntoasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of\\ngetting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t\\nwork.\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like\\ndirecting troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything\\nelse he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this\\ncase, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron\\nknew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they\\ndidn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting\\ndifferent bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t\\nyou see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.”\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for\\nthe food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early\\nin the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at\\nthe foot of his bed.\\n“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\\npulled on his bathrobe.\\n“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!”\\n“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\\nwas a lot bigger than Harry’s.\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\\nscrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit\\nlike an owl.\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\\n“That’s friendly,” said Harry.\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n“Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is money?”\\n“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. “Hagrid\\nand my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”\\n“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and\\npointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any\\npresents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.”\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own,\\n“and mine’s always maroon.”\\n“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\\ntasty.\\nHis next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs\\nfrom Hermione.\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light.\\nHe unwrapped it.\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay\\nin gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\\nEvery Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is —\\nthey’re really rare, and really valuable.”\\n“What is it?”\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\\ntouch, like water woven into material.\\n“It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure\\nit is — try it on.”\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n“It is! Look down!”\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\\nmirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\\nin midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\\nhis reflection vanished completely.\\n“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\\nwriting he had never seen before were the following words:Your father left this in my possession before he died.\\nIt is time it was returned to you.\\nUse it well.\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\\ncloak.\\n“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the\\nmatter?”\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\\nit really once belonged to his father?\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\\nout of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\\n“Merry Christmas!”\\n“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”\\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\\non it, the other a G.\\n“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s\\nsweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”\\n“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on,\\nget it on, they’re lovely and warm.”\\n“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\\n“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose she\\nthinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we know we’re\\ncalled Gred and Forge.”\\n“What’s all this noise?”\\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\\n“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even\\nHarry got one.”\\n“I — don’t — want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the\\nsweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\\n“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George.\\n“Christmas is a time for family.”\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\\nhis sweater.Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat,\\nroast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce –\\nand stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\\nparty favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually\\nbought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry\\npulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast\\nlike a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\\ninside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High\\nTable, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet,\\nand was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing\\nProfessor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and\\nblushed, her top hat lopsided.\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\\nballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The\\nwhite mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to\\nend up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\\nsnowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his\\nnew chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have\\nlost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch\\nPercy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his\\nprefect badge.\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\\nnagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he\\nfree to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\\nfell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\\nHis father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his\\nhands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\\naround himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.\\nIt was a very funny feeling.\\nUse it well.\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to\\nhim in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark\\nand silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never\\nknow.\\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him\\nback — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted\\nto use it alone.\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\\nand climbed through the portrait hole.\\n“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\\nquickly down the corridor.\\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\\nit came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long\\nas he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the\\ninvisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\\nway along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in\\nmidair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave\\nhim the creeps.\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping\\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he\\nheld up his lamp to read the titles.\\nThey didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\\nwords in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all. One\\nbook had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back\\nof Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought\\na faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\\nwas there who shouldn’t be.\\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\\nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\\nvery heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was\\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\\nunbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\\noutside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed\\nFilch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and\\nHarry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the\\nbook’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so\\nbusy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was\\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all.\\nThere was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors\\nabove there.\\n“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\\nwandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted\\nSection.”\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\\nknow a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his\\nhorror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be\\nfar, we’ll catch them.”\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\\nahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they\\ncame much nearer they’d knock right into him — the cloak didn’t stop him from\\nbeing solid.\\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\\nwas his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to\\nmove it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their\\nnoticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\\nbreathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\\nvery close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\\nhad hidden in.\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\\nwere piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket – but\\npropped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it\\nbelonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep\\nit out of the way.\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\\nframe, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\\ntop: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\\nwas no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\\nlook at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. Hewhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\\nhad screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\\ncrowd of people standing right behind him.\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\\nthe mirror.\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder —\\nbut still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a\\nroom full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them,\\ninvisible or not?\\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air\\nbehind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so\\nclose together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her\\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\\ngreen — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying;\\nsmiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\\nnext to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\\nuntidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\\nthat of his reflection.\\n“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”\\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces\\nof the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other\\nnoses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s\\nknobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\\nright through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\\njoy, half terrible sadness.\\nHow long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not fade\\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\\nHe couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away\\nfrom his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\\n“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to\\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.”\\n“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house\\nthis summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not\\nfinding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating\\nanything?”\\nHarry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\\nagain tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very\\nimportant anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What\\ndid it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\\nroom again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more\\nslowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library,\\nwandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\n“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”\\n“No!” Harry hissed. I know it’s here somewhere.”\\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but\\nsaw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold,\\nHarry spotted the suit of armor.\\n“It’s here — just here — yes!”\\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.\\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\\n“See?” Harry whispered.\\n“I can’t see anything.”\\n“Look! Look at them all…there are loads of them.…”\\n“I can only see you.”\\n“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t see\\nhis family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\n“Look at me!” he said.\\n“Can you see all your family standing around you?”\\n“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m head\\nboy!”\\n“What?”\\n“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding thehouse cup and the Quidditch cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too.”\\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\\nHarry.\\n“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\\n“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —”\\n“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”\\n“You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? I\\nwant to see my parents.”\\n“Don’t push me —”\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\\nThey hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n“Quick!”\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\\ncame round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same\\nthing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and\\nleft.\\n“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\\nCome on.”\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.\\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.\\n“No.”\\n“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”\\n“No…you go…”\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go back\\ntonight.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had\\ntoo many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering\\naround. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you\\nknock something over?”\\n“You sound like Hermione.”\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\\nfront of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking\\nso fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meetanyone.\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\\nhis grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of\\nthe mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his\\nfamily. Nothing at all.\\nExcept —\\n“So — back again, Harry?”\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him.\\nSitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.\\nHarry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he\\nhadn’t noticed him.\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said\\nDumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\\nHarry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror\\nof Erised.”\\n“I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\\n“It — well — it shows me my family —”\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”\\n“How did you know —?”\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.\\n“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”\\nHarry shook his head.\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see\\nhimself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want…\\nwhatever we want…”\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less\\nthan the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never\\nknown your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has\\nalways been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best\\nof all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men\\nhave wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven\\nmad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask\\nyou not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now beprepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.\\nNow, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”\\nHarry stood up.\\n“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”\\n“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me\\none more thing, however.”\\n“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”\\n“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”\\nHarry stared.\\n“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another\\nChristmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on\\ngiving me books.”\\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that\\nDumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he\\nshoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\nNICHOLAS FLAMEL\\nD umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised\\nagain, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed\\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in\\nthe mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and\\nover again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light,\\nwhile a high voice cackled with laughter.\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said\\nRon, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\\nview of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of\\nbed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and\\ndisappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book,\\neven though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had\\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their\\nbreaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice\\nhad started again.\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\\nhad replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained\\nthat Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side. If they won\\ntheir next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house\\nchampionship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win,\\nHarry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood\\ngave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys,\\nwho kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\n“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly the sort of\\nthing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking\\nfor any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n“Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s\\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we mightovertake Slytherin.”\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a\\nclean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end\\nof practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,\\nwhere he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing\\nHermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to\\nhim, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two\\nabout Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,\\nGryffindor can’t play at all.”\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had\\nmanaged to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs\\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker\\nCurse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and\\nperformed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,\\ntrembling. “What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with\\nHarry and Ron.\\n“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He said\\nhe’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”\\n“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report him!”\\nNeville shook his head.\\n“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.\\n“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to\\nwalking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and\\nmake it easier.”\\n“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\\nMalfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the\\nvery last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to\\nNeville, who looked as though he might cry.\\n“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose\\nyou for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”\\nNeville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\\n“Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed.…D’you want the card, you\\ncollect them, don’t you?”\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\\nand Hermione.\\n“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read\\nthe name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this:\\n‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard\\nGrindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and\\nhis work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since they’d\\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’\\ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before\\nshe was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out\\nof the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”\\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked\\nsomething up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to\\nherself.\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\\n“I knew it! I knew it!”\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored\\nhim.\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker\\nof the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone,a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any\\nmetal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the\\ndrinker immortal.\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but\\nthe only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted\\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-\\nfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six\\nhundred and fifty-eight).\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be\\nguarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe\\nfor him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he\\nwanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”\\n“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.\\n“No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent\\nDevelopments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six\\nhundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing\\nwhat they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said\\nhe’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the\\ncoming match.\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the\\nSlytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll\\nreally wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,\\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm,\\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\\nwonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to,\\nwith such a biased referee?\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether\\nSnape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were\\nturning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could\\nSnape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’tsee how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could\\nread minds.\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see\\nhim alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a\\nword of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his\\nNimbus Two Thousand.\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to\\nNeville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why\\nthey had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron\\nand Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten\\nthe idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he\\nshowed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron\\nslipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture\\nof the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too\\nmuch.”\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the\\ndoor. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”\\nHarry’s heart did a somersault.\\n“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.\\nThere was no mistaking that silver beard.\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was\\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\\nwatching.\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\\nonto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\n“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. “Look —\\nthey’re off. Ouch!”\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\\n“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone\\nwant a bet? What about you, Weasley?”\\nRon didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty becauseGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers\\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game\\nlike a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?”\\nsaid Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\\npenalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter,\\nwho’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you\\nshould be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not\\ndaring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and\\nthat’s saying something.”\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\\nabout Harry.\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”\\n“What? Where?”\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and\\ncheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as\\nHarry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\n“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money on the\\nground!” said Malfoy.\\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top\\nof him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the\\nback of his seat to help.\\n“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch\\nas Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling\\naround under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists\\nthat was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second,\\nHarry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in\\nhis hand.\\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the\\nSnitch being caught so quickly.\\n“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won! We’ve won!\\nGryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seatand hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn’t believe\\nit. He’d done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As\\nGryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced\\nand tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into\\nDumbledore’s smiling face.\\n“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.\\n“Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror...been keeping\\nbusy...excellent...”\\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two\\nThousand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling happier.\\nHe’d really done something to be proud of now – no one could say he was just a\\nfamous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked\\nover the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur:\\nGryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the\\ndistance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and\\nlooked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.\\nGryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape ....\\nAnd speaking of Snape…\\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly\\nnot wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.\\nHarry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure’s\\nprowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\\n— what was going on?\\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding\\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\nThe trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. He flew\\nin circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard\\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\\nbroomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone. Quirrell\\nwas there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he was\\nstuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\\n“…d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,\\nSeverus…”“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy.\\n“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape\\ninterrupted him.\\n“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?”\\n“B-b-but Severus, I —”\\n“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a step\\ntoward him.\\n“I-I don’t know what you—”\\n“You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied\\nhimself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m\\nwaiting.”\\n“B-but I d-d-don’t —”\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when\\nyou’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was\\nalmost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he\\nwas petrified.\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the\\nback. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and\\nGoyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all\\nright — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the common room,\\nwe’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the\\nkitchens.”\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty\\nroom, you wait ’til you hear this....”\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them,\\nthen he told them what he’d seen and heard.\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force\\nQuirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he\\nsaid something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there are other things\\nguarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and\\nQuirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break\\nthrough —”\\n“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\\nSnape?” said Hermione in alarm.“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER FOURTEEN\\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\nQ uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the weeks\\nthat followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as\\nthough he’d cracked yet.\\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still\\ngrowling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which\\nsurely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these\\ndays he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling\\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.\\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone.\\nShe had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry\\nand Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\\n“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”\\n“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a second to\\nNicolas Flamel.”\\n“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway,\\nwhat are you studying for, you already know it’s an A.”\\n“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass\\nthese exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have\\nstarted studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me.…”\\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as\\nHermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays\\nweren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with\\nHermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing\\nwand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free\\ntime in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\\n“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down\\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really\\nfine day they’d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and\\nthere was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\\nHarry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs\\nand Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doingin the library?”\\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked\\nvery out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\\n“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.\\n“An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still\\nlookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”\\n“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. “And we\\nknow what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St—”\\n“Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.\\n“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”\\n“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said\\nHarry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”\\n“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m not\\npromisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here,\\nstudents aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”\\n“See you later, then,” said Harry.\\nHagrid shuffled off.\\n“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.\\n“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”\\n“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough\\nof working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and\\nslammed them down on the table.\\n“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\\nLook at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to\\nInferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.”\\n“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met\\nhim, “ said Harry.\\n“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was outlawed by\\nthe Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop\\nMuggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden —\\nanyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns\\nCharlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”\\n“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.\\n“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\\nBlacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our\\nkind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them\\nforget.”\\n“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they\\nwere surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?”\\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was\\na blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\\nsandwiches, which they refused.\\n“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were\\nwondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from\\nFluffy.”\\nHagrid frowned at him.\\n“O’ course I can’t,“ he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number\\ntwo, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s\\nhere fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve\\nworked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”\\n“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\\nyou know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm,\\nflattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We\\nonly wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We\\nwondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\nHagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\\nHermione.\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he\\nborrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments…\\nProfessor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked\\nthem off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did\\nsomethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor\\nSnape.”\\n“Snape?”\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect\\nthe Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\\nSnape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\\nhow the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except,\\nit seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\\n“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren’t you,\\nHagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not\\neven one of the teachers?”\\n“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid proudly.“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others. “Hagrid, can we\\nhave a window open? I’m boiling.”\\n“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.\\nHarry looked at it, too.\\n“Hagrid — what’s that?”\\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath\\nthe kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\n“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — er…”\\n“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a\\ncloser look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”\\n“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’ a few\\ndrinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter\\nget rid of it, ter be honest.”\\n“But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said Hermione.\\n“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book\\nfrom under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for\\nPleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep the\\negg in the fire, ‘cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an’ when it hatches,\\nfeed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ see\\nhere — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian\\nRidgeback. They’re rare, them.”\\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\\nfire.\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening\\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\\nHermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\\nwas driving them nuts.\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\\nHagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\\nwouldn’t hear of it.\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\\nhatching?”\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to whatHagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\\nmuch had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning\\nbreak. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\\nof them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\\nedge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\\n“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.\\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\\nwas moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\\ndragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\\nlike a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\\nskinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\\nbulging, orange eyes.\\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\\nthe dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\\n“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.\\n“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\\nexactly?”\\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his\\nface — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid —\\nhe’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”\\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\\nmistaking him.\\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week\\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free\\ntime in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\\n“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”\\n“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”\\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just aweek. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his\\ngamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were\\nempty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\\n“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\\nwith misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s\\nMommy?”\\n“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to\\nbe as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.”\\nHagrid bit his lip.\\n“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.”\\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. “Charlie.” he said.\\n“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”\\n“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him\\nback in the wild!”\\n“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”\\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to\\nask him.\\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and\\nHarry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst\\nopen. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak.\\nHe had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now\\neating dead rats by the crate.\\n“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\\nbloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell\\nyou, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid\\ngoes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he\\ntold me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.”\\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\\n“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll have Charlie’s\\nanswer!”\\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\\nDear Ron,\\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take the NorwegianRidgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to\\nsend him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.\\nTrouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday?\\nThey can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark.\\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\\nLove,\\nCharlie\\nThey looked at one another.\\n“We’ve got the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn’t be too\\ndifficult – I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.”\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\\nagreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to\\ntwice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam\\nPomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had\\nno choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s\\nfangs were poisonous.\\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\n“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s about\\nto fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books\\nso he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her\\nwhat really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me\\n— I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.”\\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\n“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t\\nsoothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\\n“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no oh no — I’ve\\njust remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to\\nknow we’re getting rid of Norbert.”\\nHarry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey\\ncame over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\n“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We haven’t got\\ntime to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid ofNorbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy\\ndoesn’t know about that.”\\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail\\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\\n“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I\\ncan’t handle.”\\nWhen they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with tears,\\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\\n“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s only a\\nbaby, after all.”\\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry\\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly\\nenough.\\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\\ngood-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had to do. It\\nwas a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid’s hut\\nbecause they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\\nwhere he’d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and\\nready in a large crate.\\n“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a\\nmuffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.”\\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\\n“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the\\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy\\nwill never forget you!”\\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\\nknew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in\\nthe entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another\\n– even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier.\\n“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\\ntallest tower.\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the\\ncrate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows,\\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet\\naway. A lamp flared.\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\\nthe ear.“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering\\naround in the middle of the night, how dare you —”\\n“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a\\ndragon!”\\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see\\nProfessor Snape about you, Malfoy!”\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\\nthing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air\\ndid they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione\\ndid a sort of jig.\\n“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”\\n“Don’t,” Harry advised her.\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his\\ncrate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the\\ndarkness.\\nCharlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione\\nthe harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They\\nall helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook\\nhands with the others and thanked them very much.\\nAt last, Norbert was going…going…gone.\\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their\\nhands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention\\n— what could spoil their happiness?\\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped\\ninto the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\\n“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.”\\nThey’d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER FIFTEEN\\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST\\nT hings couldn’t have been worse.\\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor,\\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was\\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around\\nHarry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were\\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have\\nbeen so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that\\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping\\naround the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy\\ntower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the\\ninvisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong.\\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\\n“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was\\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you,\\nhe said you had a drag—”\\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she\\ntowered over the three of them.\\n“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were\\nup in the astronomy tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”\\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s\\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\n“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy\\nsome cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into\\ntrouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom\\nhere heard the story and believed it, too?”\\nHarry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this\\nwasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering\\nNeville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the\\ndark, to warn them.“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out of bed in\\none night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought\\nyou had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to\\nyou than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr.\\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night,\\nespecially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from\\nGryffindor.”\\n“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in\\nthe last Quidditch match.\\n“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\\nthrough her long, pointed nose.\\n“Professor — please —”\\n“You can’t —”\\n“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all\\nof you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one\\nnight, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt\\nas though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever\\nmake up for this?\\nHarry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to\\ncomfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What\\nwould happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house\\npoints the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly\\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started\\nto spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch\\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first\\nyears.\\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\\nHarry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on\\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup.\\nEverywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices\\nas they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past\\nthem, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”\\nOnly Ron stood by him.\\n“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads\\nof points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have\\nthey?” said Harry miserably.\\n“Well — no,” Ron admitted.\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to\\nmeddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with\\nsneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood\\nand offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going to\\nget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak\\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him\\n“the Seeker.”\\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a time\\nas Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them,\\neither. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her\\nhead down and working in silence.\\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the studying\\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in\\ncomplicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of\\nmagical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new\\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an\\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he\\nheard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he\\nheard Quirrell’s voice.\\n“No — no — not again, please —”\\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\\n“All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob.\\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\\nhis turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out\\nof sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until\\nQuirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before\\nhe remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling.\\nAll the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had\\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\\nwith a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron onAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break\\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,”\\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a\\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So\\nwhat do we do, Harry?”\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione\\nanswered before Harry could.\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try\\nanything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us\\nup. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween\\nand that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe,\\nhim or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it\\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too\\nfriendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.\\nAnd don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll\\ntake a lot of explaining.”\\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.\\n“If we just do a bit of poking around —”\\n“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”\\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\\nits moons.\\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\\nNeville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\\nYour detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.\\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\\nProfessor McGonagall\\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points\\nthey’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night\\nof studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved\\nwhat they’d got.\\nAt eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there— and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a\\ndetention, too.\\n“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\n“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you,\\neh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the best teachers\\nif you ask me….It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out…hang you\\nby your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my\\noffice, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…Right, off we go, and\\ndon’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”\\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\\nwondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really\\nhorrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.\\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\\ninto darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then\\nthey heard a distant shout.\\n“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”\\nHarry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\\nwouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said,\\n“I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,\\nboy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come\\nout in one piece.”\\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\\ntracks.\\n“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual.\\n“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there —\\nwerewolves, I heard.”\\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.\\n“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with glee.\\n“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t\\nyou?”\\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\\nwas carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\\n“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All right,\\nHarry, Hermione?”\\n“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, they’re\\nhere to be punished, after all.”\\n“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin lecturin’\\nthem, eh? ‘Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from\\nhere.”“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added\\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away\\nin the darkness.\\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\n“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the\\nnote of panic in his voice.\\n“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve\\ndone wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”\\n“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be\\ncopying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d—”\\n“—tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. “Copyin’ lines!\\nWhat good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh\\nthink yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’\\npack. Go on.”\\nMalfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\\ngaze.\\n“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ‘cause it’s dangerous\\nwhat we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over\\nhere a moment.”\\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\\npointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black\\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\\n“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery\\nstuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re\\ngonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”\\n“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy,\\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or\\nFang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter\\ntwo parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the\\nplace, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.”\\n“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.\\n“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry,\\nan’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if\\nany of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out\\nan’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks,\\nan’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork inthe earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang took the right.\\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\\nthe fallen leaves.\\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\n“Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.\\n“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re\\npowerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”\\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\\nblood here and there along the winding path.\\n“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it can’t’ve\\ngone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT\\nTREE!”\\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\\na towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\\nready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\\nleaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\\nsquinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\\n“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”\\n“A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\\n“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid\\ngrimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”\\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\\nin a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\n“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”\\nAnd into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\\nman, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut\\nbody with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.\\n“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”\\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.\\n“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\\nvoice. “Were you going to shoot me?”\\n“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\\n“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione\\nGranger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you two. He’s\\na centaur.\\n“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn\\nmuch, up at the school?”\\n“Erm —”\\n“A bit,” said Hermione timidly.\\n“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\\nand stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter\\nyeh, Ronan, ‘cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”\\nRonan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\\nsighed again.\\n“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for\\nages past, so it is now.”\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’ Ronan? Anythin’\\nunusual?”\\n“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\\nimpatiently. “Unusually bright.”\\n“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home, said\\nHagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”\\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\\nhides many secrets.”\\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\\nbut it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\\nthan Ronan.\\n“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”\\n“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”\\n“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in\\nhere lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”\\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\\nbright tonight,” he said simply.\\n“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\\nanythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”\\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\n“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a\\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”\\n“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\\n“Oh, a fair few….Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re\\ngood enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind,\\ncentaurs…they know things…jus’ don’ let on much.”“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.\\n“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s\\nbin killin’ the unicorns – never heard anythin’ like it before.”\\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\\nHe was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\\npassed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm.\\n“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”\\n“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll come back\\nfor yeh!”\\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\\nlooking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the\\nrustling of leaves around them.\\n“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.\\n“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our fault\\nhe’s here in the first place.”\\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry’s\\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\\ngoing on? Where were the others?\\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\\nsneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\\nsent up the sparks.\\n“We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were\\nmakin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’\\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a\\nwhisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta\\nget this done.”\\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\\nthought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\\nof a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\\nHarry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\\noak.\\n“Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angleswhere it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\\nfreeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.…Then, out\\nof the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\\nstalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\\nreached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and\\nbegan to drink its blood.\\n“AAAAAAAAAARGH!”\\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded\\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling\\ndown its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t\\nmove for fear.\\nThen a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\\nhis scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\\nfigure.\\nThe pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\\nor two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\\nover him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\\nand a palomino body.\\n“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\n“Yes — thank you — what was that?”\\nThe centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\\nout, livid, on Harry’s forehead.\\n“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\\nThe forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\\nquicker this way.\\n“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\\nclearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\\nand sweaty.\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\\nyour back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\\nquicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\\n“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze,\\nwe are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what isto come in the movements of the planets?”\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was\\nacting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\\nwhat has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\\nstray humans in our forest!”\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\\ngrab his shoulders to stay on.\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not\\nunderstand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\\nset myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\\nalongside me if I must.”\\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\n“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\\nfrom, anyway?”\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\\nof low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their\\nway through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t\\nwant to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\\npatch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\\n“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn\\nand tail hair in Potions.”\\n“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.\\n“Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\\ndeath, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\\nthe blood touches your lips.”\\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in\\nthe moonlight.\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to\\nbe cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\\nto drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength\\nand power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do youknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t\\nunderstand who —”\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\\nwho has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart.\\nOver the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\\nhim on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\\nDunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\\nbehind her.\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The\\nunicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”\\n“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\\nexamine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read\\nwrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\\nshivering behind him.\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\\nHe shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\\nhim and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\\nwas still shaking.\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the\\nforest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought\\nVoldemort could hear them.\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious…\\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\\nhappen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze\\nshould have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”\\n“Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went\\non feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I\\nsuppose Bane’ll be happy.”\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was\\never afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you.\\nAnyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\\nand Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed\\nexhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded\\nneatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\nJust in case.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER SIXTEEN\\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\\nI n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed\\nto get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\\nthrough the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no\\ndoubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did\\ntheir written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams,\\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell.\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.\\nProfessor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points\\nwere given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.\\nSnape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to\\nremember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.\\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t\\nsleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare,\\nexcept that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure\\ndripping blood in it.\\nMaybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\\nor because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and\\nHermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of\\nVoldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and\\nthey were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about\\nwhat Snape or anyone else might be up to.\\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\\nquestions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and\\nthey’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came\\nout. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and\\nroll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.\\n“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they\\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learnedabout the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.”\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but\\nRon said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped\\nunder a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a\\ngiant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron\\nsighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful,\\nHarry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no\\nneed to worry yet.”\\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps\\nhurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\ncoming….”\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s\\naround. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past\\nFluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a\\nhurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets\\nDumbledore down.”\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was\\nsomething he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain\\nthis, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was\\nhalfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that\\none.”\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with\\nwork, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue\\nsky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him\\nletters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone\\nhow to get past Fluffy…never…but….\\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white.\\n“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\\nslope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a\\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many\\npeople wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky theyfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the\\ngrounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\\nsleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?”\\n“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know\\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with\\nlook like?”\\n“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\\n“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head —\\nthat’s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I\\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.”\\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him\\nabout, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”\\n“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\\n“Yeah…he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here…He asked a\\nbit about the sorta creatures I took after…so I told him…an’ I said what I’d\\nalways really wanted was a dragon…an’ then…I can’ remember too well, ‘cause\\nhe kept buyin’ me drinks…Let’s see…yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg\\nan’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted…but he had ter be sure I could handle\\nit, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home….So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon\\nwould be easy.…”\\n“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to\\nkeep his voice calm.\\n“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around\\nHogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him\\ndown, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep —”\\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\n“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey —\\nwhere’re yeh goin’?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they\\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the\\ngrounds.\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger\\nhow to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak —\\nit must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledorebelieves us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s\\nDumbledore’s office?”\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right\\ndirection. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\\nanyone who had been sent to see him.\\n“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the\\nhall.\\n“What are you three doing inside?”\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely,\\nHarry and Ron thought.\\n“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\\nHarry swallowed — now what?\\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because\\nProfessor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.\\n“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He\\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at\\nonce.”\\n“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”\\n“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\\ndemands on his time – ”\\n“But this is important.”\\n“Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\\nMagic, Potter?”\\n“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s\\nabout the Sorcerer’s Stone —”\\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books\\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.\\n“How do you know —?” she spluttered.\\n“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going to try\\nand steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”\\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\n“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I don’t\\nknow how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly\\nsteal it, it’s too well protected.”\\n“But Professor —”\\n“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down\\nand gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy thesunshine.”\\nBut they didn’t.\\n“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\\nout of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out\\neverything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that\\nnote, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\\nup.”\\n“But what can we —”\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\nSnape was standing there.\\n“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.\\nThey stared at him.\\n“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted\\nsmile.\\n“We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\\n“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this,\\npeople will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to\\nlose any more points, can it?”\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\\n“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will\\npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”\\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us\\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if\\nhe leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”\\n“Why me?”\\n“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\\nFlitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so\\nworried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\\nSnape.\\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron.\\n“Come on.”\\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the\\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall\\nturned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of\\nenchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve comeanywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes,\\nWeasley, from my own house!”\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At\\nleast Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open\\nand Hermione came in.\\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I\\nwas doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and\\nI’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\\n“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.\\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone\\nfirst.”\\n“You’re mad!” said Ron.\\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have\\nsaid? You’ll be expelled!”\\n“SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold\\nof the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like\\nwhen he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled\\nfrom! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points\\ndoesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your\\nfamilies alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get\\nto the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to\\nfind me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never\\ngoing over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\\nyou two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\\nHe glared at them.\\n“You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\\n“I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”\\n“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.\\n“All — all three of us?”\\n“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to\\nthe Stone without us? I’d better go and took through my books, there might be\\nsomething useful….”\\n“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”\\n“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret\\nthat I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me\\nout after that.”After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\\nNobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\\nany more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione\\nwas skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the\\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much.\\nBoth of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out\\nthe cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.\\nHe pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.\\nHe ran back down to the common room.\\n“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\\n– if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —”\\n“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\\nappeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as\\nthough he’d been making another bid for freedom.\\n“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\\nbehind his back.\\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\\n“You’re going out again,” he said.\\n“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed,\\nNeville?”\\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford\\nto waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\\n“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will\\nbe in even more trouble.”\\n“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”\\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\\nI won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait\\nhole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”\\n“Neville, “Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot\\n—”\\n“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. I don’t think you should be\\nbreaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\\npeople!”\\n“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t know\\nwhat you’re doing.”\\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leaptout of sight.\\n“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!”\\nHarry turned to Hermione.\\n“Do something,” he said desperately.\\nHermione stepped forward.\\n“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”\\nShe raised her wand.\\n“Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\nNeville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\\nbody rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a\\nboard.\\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so\\nhe couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\\n“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.\\n“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so\\nsorry.”\\n“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.\\n“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and\\npulled on the invisibility cloak.\\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very\\ngood omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every\\ndistant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot\\nof the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\\n“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but\\nHarry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned\\nher lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.\\nThey didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\\nthird floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people\\nwould trip.\\n“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\\nnarrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you.\\nAre you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”\\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\\n“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.”\\nHarry had a sudden idea.\\n“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own\\nreasons for being invisible.”\\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and\\nhovered about a foot off the stairs.“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My\\nmistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible —\\nforgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”\\n“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this\\nplace tonight.”\\n“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.\\n“Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”\\nAnd he scooted off.\\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor —\\nand the door was already ajar.\\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past\\nFluffy.”\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\\nwhat was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the\\ncloak, I won’t need it now.”\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione.\\nHarry pushed the door open.\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the\\ndog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.\\n“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\\n“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here\\ngoes ….”\\nHe put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but\\nfrom the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\\nSlowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\\nthen it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\n“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\\ncrept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they\\napproached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said\\nRon, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”\\n“No, I don’t!”\\n“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s\\nlegs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\\n“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\\n“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll justhave to drop.”\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention\\nand pointed at himself.\\n“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep\\nthis thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled\\nand twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\\nsleep.\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\\nno sign of the bottom.\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t\\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”\\n“Right,” said Ron.\\n“See you in a minute, I hope …”\\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\\ndown and —\\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\\nsoft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\\nhe was sitting on some sort of plant.\\n“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\\nwas the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”\\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\\n“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.\\n“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall.\\nCome on, Hermione!”\\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.\\n“We must be miles under the school,” she said.\\n“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.\\n“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”\\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\\ntendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\\nbound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\\nbut the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\\naround them.“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s\\nDevil’s Snare!”\\n“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled\\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut\\nup, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.\\n“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\\ncurled around his chest.\\n“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare…what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes\\nthe dark and the damp.”\\n“So light a fire!” Harry choked.\\n“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her\\nhands.\\n“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR\\nNOT?”\\n“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on\\nSnape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip\\nas it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it\\nunraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\\n“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he\\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis —\\n‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was\\nthe only way forward.\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water\\ntrickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was\\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the\\ndragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a\\nfully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\\nahead.\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a\\nbrilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the oppositeside of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.\\n“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if\\nthey all swooped down at once…well, there’s no other choice…I’ll run.”\\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any\\nsecond, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the\\nhandle, but it was locked.\\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\\nwouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\\n“Now what?” said Ron.\\n“These birds…they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.\\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?\\n“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys\\n— look carefully. So that must mean…” he looked around the chamber while the\\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. “…yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve\\ngot to catch the key to the door!”\\n“But there are hundreds of them!”\\nRon examined the lock on the door.\\n“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the\\nhandle.”\\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched\\nkeys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving\\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that\\nhad a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\\nkeyhole.\\n“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — no, there\\n— with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.”\\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\n“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key\\nwith the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay\\nbelow and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”\\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and\\nHarry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron andHermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his\\nhand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock\\nhad clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had\\nbeen caught twice.\\n“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\\nnodded. He pulled the door open.\\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as\\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\\nsight.\\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like\\nblack stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry,\\nRon and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no\\nfaces.\\n“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.\\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the\\nroom.”\\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n“How?” said Hermione nervously.\\n“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”\\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s\\nhorse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\\nknight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\n“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight\\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\n“This needs thinking about…” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the\\nplace of three of the black pieces….”\\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\\n“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\\n—”\\n“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”\\n“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\\nto him instead of that castle.”\\n“What about you?”\\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.\\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\\noff the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board.\\n“Yes…look…”\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\\nsent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\\n“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”\\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\\nquite still, facedown.\\n“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to\\ntake that bishop, Hermione, go on.”\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\\nRon only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\\nhimself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\\nlost black ones.\\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me\\nthink…”\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n“Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”\\n“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I\\ntake one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate\\nthe king, Harry!”\\n“But —”\\n“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\\n“Ron —”\\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”\\nThere was no alternative.\\n“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now,\\ndon’t hang around once you’ve won.”\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\\nacross the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione\\nscreamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\\nHe looked as if he’d been knocked out.\\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had\\nwon. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\\nlast desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the doorand up the next passageway.\\n“What if he’s —?”\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you\\nreckon’s next?”\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put\\ncharms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\\nthat leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\\nThey had reached another door.\\n“All right?” Harry whispered.\\n“Go on.”\\nHarry pushed it open.\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\\nrobes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\\nthem, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\\nlump on its head.\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they\\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\\ncame next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\\n“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\\nthem in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\\nlooked over her shoulder to read it:\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\\nYou will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;\\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\\nthe very last thing he felt like doing.\\n“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A\\nlot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here\\nforever.”\\n“But so will we, won’t we?”\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this\\npaper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\\nthrough the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\\n“But how do we know which to drink?”\\n“Give me a minute.”\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\\nthe line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\\nher hands.\\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black\\nfire — toward the Stone.”\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one\\nswallow.”\\nThey looked at each other.\\n“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\\nbrooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past\\nFluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\\nhim. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,\\nreally.”\\n“But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”\\n“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I\\nmight get lucky again.”\\nHermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\\narms around him.\\n“Hermione!”\\n“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\\nhim.\\n“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more\\nimportant things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”\\n“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”\\n“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\\nthe end, and shuddered.\\n“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.\\n“No — but it’s like ice.”\\n“Quick, go, before it wears off.”\\n“Good luck — take care.”\\n“GO!”\\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to\\nface the black flames.\\n“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\\ndown and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his\\nbody, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\\n— then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\\nThere was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape. It wasn’t even\\nVoldemort.HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\nSorcerer's StoneCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\\nI t was Quirrell.\\n“You!” gasped Harry.\\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.\\n“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here,\\nPotter.”\\n“But I thought — Snape —”\\n“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble,\\neither, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So\\nuseful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who\\nwould suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”\\nHarry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.\\n“But Snape tried to kill me!”\\n“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I’d have got you off\\nthat broom. I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a\\ncountercurse, trying to save you.”\\n“Snape was trying to save me?”\\n“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted to\\nreferee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny,\\nreally…he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore\\nwatching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor\\nfrom winning, he did make himself unpopular…and what a waste of time, when\\nafter all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”\\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\\nthemselves tightly around Harry.\\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\\nHalloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was\\nguarding the Stone.”\\n“You let the troll in?”\\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I\\ndid to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone elsewas running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\\nstraight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat\\nyou to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off\\nproperly.\\n“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”\\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\\nwas the Mirror of Erised.\\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping\\nhis way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like\\nthis…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.\\n“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\\n“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected\\nme all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord\\nVoldemort on my side….”\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\\n“I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He\\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\\n“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\\nwith your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never\\nwanted you dead.”\\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was\\nthreatening you.…”\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.\\n“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions\\n— he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\\n“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.\\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I\\ntraveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\\nideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\\nis no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it…Since\\nthen, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\\nhas had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive\\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\\ndispleased. He punished me…decided he would have to keep a closer watch onme.…”\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\\nAlley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very\\nday, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\n“I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?”\\nHarry’s mind was racing.\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\\nthought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\\nshould see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how\\ncan I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\\nnoticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\\nQuirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\\nfrom Quirrell himself.\\n“Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.”\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\\ngot slowly to his feet.\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what\\nyou see.”\\nHarry walked toward him.\\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see,\\nthat’s all.\\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\\nseemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of\\nthe mirror, and opened them again.\\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\\nlater, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\\nblood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did\\nso, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly\\n— he’d gotten the Stone.\\n“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”\\nHarry screwed up his courage.\\n“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I — I’ve\\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.”Quirrell cursed again.\\n“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\\nSorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\nBut he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\\nQuirrell wasn’t moving his lips.\\n“He lies…He lies.…”\\n“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did\\nyou just see?”\\nThe high voice spoke again.\\n“Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”\\n“Master, you are not strong enough!”\\n“I have strength enough…for this…”\\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t\\nmove a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\\nunwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head\\nlooked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there\\nshould have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible\\nface Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for\\nnostrils, like a snake.\\n“Harry Potter…” it whispered.\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.\\n“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor….I\\nhave form only when I can share another’s body…but there have always been\\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn blood has\\nstrengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me\\nin the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body\\nof my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”\\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. He\\nstumbled backward.\\n“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join\\nme…or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging me for\\nmercy…”\\n“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.\\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\\nhim. The evil face was now smiling.\\n“How touching…” it hissed. “I always value bravery….Yes, boy, your\\nparents were brave…I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous\\nfight…but your mother needn’t have died…she was trying to protect you…Nowgive me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.”\\n“NEVER!”\\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE\\nHIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At\\nonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it\\nwas about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked\\naround wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\\nlooking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.\\n“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\\nlunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands\\naround Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he\\ncould see Quirrell howling in agony.\\n“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”\\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\\nof his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they\\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.\\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct,\\nreached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —\\n“AAAARGH!”\\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\\nQuirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his\\nonly chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\\nfrom doing a curse.\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\\nas he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in\\nHarry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s\\nterrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other\\nvoices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”\\nHe felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\\nfell into blackness, down…down… down….\\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\\nbut his arms were too heavy.\\nHe blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\\nstrange.\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\\nview above him.“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was\\nQuirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”\\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said\\nDumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”\\n“Then who does? Sir, I —”\\n“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\\nhospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\\nwas a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.\\n“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends\\nMisters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\\nseat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\\nit might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\\n“How long have I been in here?”\\n“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\\nrelieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”\\n“But sir, the Stone —”\\n“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,\\nalthough you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”\\n“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”\\n“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\\nit became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I\\narrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.”\\n“It was you.”\\n“I feared I might be too late.”\\n“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer –”\\n“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\\nterrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\\ndestroyed.”\\n“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —”\\n“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite\\ndelighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have\\nhad a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”\\n“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”\\n“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,they will die.”\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.\\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\\nPerenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\\nwell-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\\nwas really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\\nwant! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble\\nis, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\\nthem.”\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\\nat the ceiling.\\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone,\\nVol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.”\\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t\\nhe? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\\nfor another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\\nQuirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\\nNevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\\nwill merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\\nbattle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\\nreturn to power.”\\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\\nhe said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me…\\nthings I want to know the truth about.…”\\n“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and\\nshould therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your\\nquestions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll\\nforgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”\\n“Well…Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\\nto stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first\\nplace?”\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now.\\nYou will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are\\nolder…I know you hate to hear this…when you are ready, you will know.”\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”\\n“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\\nunderstand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s\\nfor you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign…to have been loved so\\ndeeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\\nprotection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and\\nambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It\\nwas agony to touch a person marked by something so good.”\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice\\nagain, Harry said, “And the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to\\nme?”\\n“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\\nyou might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things…your father\\nused it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.”\\n“And there’s something else…”\\n“Fire away.”\\n“Quirrell said Snape —”\\n“Professor Snape, Harry.”\\n“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that\\ntrue?”\\n“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”\\n“What?”\\n“He saved his life.”\\n“What?”\\n“Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds\\nwork, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt…I do\\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would\\nmake him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s\\nmemory in peace.…”\\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\\n“And sir, there’s one more thing…”\\n“Just the one?”\\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”\\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\\nideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. You see, only one who\\nwanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it,\\notherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. Mybrain surprises even me sometimes…Now, enough questions. I suggest you\\nmake a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was\\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since\\nthen I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with\\na nice toffee, don’t you?”\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\\nchoked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\n“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.\\n“Absolutely not.”\\n“You let Professor Dumbledore in….”\\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”\\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\nPomfrey…”\\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”\\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\\n“Harry!”\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry\\nwas glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so\\nworried —”\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really\\nhappened?”\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell;\\nthe mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good\\naudience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was\\nunder Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to\\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed\\nat how crazy his hero was.\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that\\ntook a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore\\nwhen we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said,\\n‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your\\nfather’s cloak and everything?”\\n“Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say that’s terrible —\\nyou could have been killed.”\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I\\nthink he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less\\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we\\nwere going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I\\ndon’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s\\nalmost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could….”\\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen,\\nyou’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\\nSlytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were\\nsteamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT” she said firmly.\\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\nI want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his\\nmany candy boxes. I can, can’t I?”\\n“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said\\nstiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky\\nfeasts could be. “And you have another visitor.”\\n“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”\\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took\\none look at him, and burst into tears.\\n“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his hands. I\\ntold the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he\\ndidn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I’ll never\\ndrink again! I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!”\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out\\nsomehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you\\nhadn’t told him.”\\n“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!”\\n“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he\\nstopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\\nHagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog,I’ve got loads.…”\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That reminds\\nme. I’ve got yeh a present.”\\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid\\ngave a weak chuckle.\\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ‘course, he\\nshoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this.…”\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\\ncuriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from\\nevery page were his mother and father.\\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos…\\nknew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”\\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had\\nbeen held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one\\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the\\nSlytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the house\\ncup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent\\ncovered the wall behind the High Table.\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody\\nstarted talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up\\nto look at him.\\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble\\nyou with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\\ndelicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little\\nfuller than they were…you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and\\nempty before next year starts.…\\n“Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\\npoints stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve\\npoints; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has\\nfour hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\\nHarry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\\nsight.\\n“Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent\\nevents must be taken into account.”The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\\nLet me see. Yes…\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\\n“…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\\naward Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead\\nseemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My brother,\\nyou know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set!”\\nAt last there was silence again.\\n“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool logic in the\\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\\nburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —\\nthey were a hundred points up.\\n“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. The room went\\ndeadly quiet. “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor\\nhouse sixty points.”\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\\nthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two\\npoints — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if\\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a\\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to\\nour friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”\\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\\nsort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the\\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as\\nNeville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering,\\nnudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more\\nstunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need\\na little change of decoration.”\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\\nand the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a toweringGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand,\\nwith a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that\\nSnape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It\\nseemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever\\nwas at Hogwarts.\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch,\\nor Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget\\ntonight.\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come\\nthey did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped\\nthrough, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They\\nhad hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be\\nthrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t\\nhave everything in life.\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\\nNeville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out\\nto all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope\\nthey’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to\\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were\\nboarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became\\ngreener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past\\nMuggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;\\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station.\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old\\nguard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and\\nthrees so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once\\nand alarming the Muggles.\\n“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll\\nsend you an owl.”\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People\\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle\\nworld. Some of them called:\\n“Bye, Harry!”\\n“See you, Potter!”\\n“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.\\n“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. “There heis, Mom, there he is, look!”\\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at\\nRon.\\n“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —”\\n“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”\\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\\n“Busy year?” she said.\\n“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\\nWeasley.”\\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”\\n“Ready, are you?”\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of\\nordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at\\nthe very sight of Harry.\\n“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we\\nhaven’t got all day.” He walked away.\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\n“See you over the summer, then.”\\n“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking\\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\\n“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was\\nspreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at\\nhome. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.…\""
